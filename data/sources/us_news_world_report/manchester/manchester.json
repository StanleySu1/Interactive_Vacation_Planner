{"name": "Manchester", "description": ["If you could see what Manchester was like a couple of centuries ago, you would've viewed an industrial city as it churned out cotton. In fact, it was the world's first industrialized city. Sure, Manchester pays homage to its roots with a handful of museums and the preservation of some historic buildings, but Manchester hardly dwells in the past. Rather than cotton, these days, Manchester is cranking out a contagious energy. Today, the Capital of the North is defined by music \u2013 bands like The Smiths, Blossoms and Oasis all got their starts here. The city is also fervent about its soccer (or football, in the U.K.): In fact, Manchester United might well be one of the world's most revered teams. And when it comes to food, you'll find that Manchester's restaurant scene is experiencing new energy. It's known for its vegan and vegetarian cuisine, as well as halal.", "The best time to visit Manchester is between June and August when the weather is warm and the city's events calendar is packed.

They also use a number of words in different contexts. For example, \"scran\" is another word for \"food.\" Or to say, \"That's great,\" a local might say, \"That's mint\" or \u201cIt's top!\"", "When it comes to currency, you'll be using the British pound sterling. Since the pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. Major credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops. And in case you're wondering about tipping, here are the rules: In sit-down restaurants, it has become customary to tip about 10%. In a taxi, rounding the fare to the nearest 1 pound (about $1.30) should be sufficient. No tip is expected in bars and pubs.", "The British are generally reserved and polite and generally don't do a lot of touching. You'll want to be sure to shake hands, with a light touch (unlike Americans who prefer a firm handshake), and keep your hands (not elbows) on the table during meals.

The most violent crimes occur in the city's Gay Village neighborhood. Picadilly Gardens also sees a high number of crimes, so take extra precaution in these areas. If you're taking taxis, make sure they are the licensed black cabs from a taxi rank.
