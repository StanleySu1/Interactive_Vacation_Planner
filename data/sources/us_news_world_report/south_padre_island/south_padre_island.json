{"name": "South Padre Island", "description": ["Every March, like clockwork, students cram into cars and head to South Padre Island for spring break fun in the sun and 24-hour beach bashes. While the island is still home to spring breakers for just over a month, the area has seen a rebirth of sorts as a popular family vacation destination. That's because South Padre, or SPI, delivers with wide sandy beaches, sparkling blue water and a mixture of fun activities for kids of all ages.", "But there\u2019s more to SPI than beach revelry. Kiteboarding is a favorite pastime and several sports outfitters offer deep-sea fishing trips and dolphin-watching excursions. The consistently warm weather also seduces northern Texans seeking refuge from the cold. And it's understandable: Just a day's drive from major Texas cities like Houston and Dallas, this seaside paradise is right in the state's own backyard.", "The best time to visit South Padre Island is from September to February. Unless you are planning to join in on the spring break fun \u2013 rowdy partying at all hours of the day \u2013 you'll find this tiny town rather unbearable in March. However, during the other 11 months out of the year, SPI exudes a relaxed aura perfect for sun-seekers and families. Plus hotel rates are reasonably low compared to other beach destinations. Just be advised that if you're planning a summer trip, there's a slight chance you'll encounter some unfriendly hurricane weather.", "Safety first If you're in town for spring break, remember that the bright sunshine can maximize the effects of alcohol. Don't forget to eat regularly, drink plenty of water and keep your friends close by.", "Know which way the storm is headed If you're visiting between June and November, make sure to pay close attention to the weather. South Padre is sometimes prone to hurricanes.", "Reserve in advance Although it's not hard to find a decent room, consider booking at least a few weeks in advance, especially during the winter when SPI welcomes an influx of snowbirds.", "Leave the car behind Don't waste money on a rental car. South Padre is small enough to explore on foot and the free Island Metro offers regular transportation around town and across Laguna Madre to Port Isabel.", "One of the perks of vacationing at a beach destination is the fresh seafood, and SPI is no different. Enjoy a plate of fresh oysters while watching the dolphins play in the Gulf, or you can sample one of the many types of fish that can be found in Laguna Madre, including marlin, red snapper, kingfish and flounder. Cafe on the Beach at the Palms resort and Beachside Bar & Grill at the Pearl South Padre Island Resort are beloved spots offering ocean views, outdoor seating and a wide array of excellent seafood dishes. ", "Thanks to the large influx of tourism, the South Padre restaurant scene has diversified and you can now find establishments serving everything from Polynesian to Italian fare. Barry's International South Padre Island has everything from Tex-Mex to Italian to seafood dishes. The island is also home to numerous burger joints \u2013 Padre Island Brewing Company is a popular spot where typical American fare is served and the local brews are abundant. For something sweet, reviewers say you can't go wrong with the pancakes at Yummies Bistro.", "South Padre Island is a popular spring break destination; unless you're looking to join the party, avoid this area in March. Other times of the year, however, South Padre is generally a safe and quiet vacation destination.", "The best way to get around South Padre Island is on foot, especially since the area clocks in at 2 square miles in size (much of which is shoreline). There is also a free public shuttle, Island Metro, which runs the length of the town and across Laguna Madre to Port Isabel. However, if you're interested in visiting some of the other outlying communities, you may want to rent a car. Getting into town from the Brownsville South Padre Island International Airport (BRO) \u2013 located about 25 miles southwest \u2013 can seem daunting, but you can make the trip without having to worry about overspending. Island Airport Shuttles pick up at the airport and can take you as far as Port Isabel where you can catch the Island Metro. Visitors can also fly into Valley International Airport (VIA) in Harlingen \u2013 about 40 miles west of South Padre \u2013 and catch the South Padre Shuttle to the island (one-way fares cost $35 per passenger). Car rentals are also available. "]}
