{"name": "Hilton Head", "description": ["To really get a feel for Hilton Head, you're going to need to slow down and enjoy the vast mix of cultures, age groups and activities. This 42-square-mile barrier island's demographics have evolved exponentially through the years. At one time, it had the reputation for catering to an older, wealthier clientele, but no longer must you rush to keep up with the Joneses. And while enormous beach houses and gated communities still dot the shoreline, an explosion of full-time islanders from the Midwest and East Coast mainland have become permanent residents and young entrepreneurs. Prior to the initial resort development that began in the 1960s, the island was largely populated by Gullah, or descendants of freed slaves, who settled here during and after the Civil War, many of whom still own businesses and restaurants locally. However, your fellow vacationers will still likely be retirees (thanks to the world-class fairways) and young vacationing families (thanks to the clean, sugary beaches).", "If you know anything about the island, you know that golfing, tennis and shopping are how it earned its upscale reputation. But you could spend an entire vacation here without ever swinging a golf club or a tennis racket. The island is full of natural wonders, including the Coastal Discovery Museum and the Pinckney Island National Wildlife Refuge, not to mention 12 miles of sandy beaches. So, whether you came to get up close and personal with Lowcountry wildlife, perfect your backhand or simply relax on the sand, Hilton Head has something for you.", "The best time to visit Hilton Head is April and May as well as September and October. Spring and fall shoulder seasons offer fewer crowds and lower lodging rates all the while maintaining temperatures that are still beach-friendly. Summer is also a great time to visit the island, as the weather is perfect for swimming in the ocean. If you want to save some money and don't mind bringing a couple sweaters with you to the beach, winter isn't a bad time to visit either, thanks to high temperatures in the mid-60s. ", "Budget for a rental car Most of Hilton Head's attractions are spread out, meaning you'll need your own set of wheels if you want to explore beyond your resort.", "Budget for the resort fee Many of the island's brand hotels charge a resort fee per night, per room. Consider looking into a vacation rental if the fees pose too big a threat to your budget.", "Be mindful of the gate fee If you're going to Sea Pines (where the iconic Harbour Town Lighthouse sits), be prepared to pay a $9 fee per car per day. Sea Pines is a privately-owned residential community (one of many on the island), meaning it's not maintained by the town, county or state. If you're staying there, however, you can easily obtain a complimentary pass. Many Sea Pines businesses and restaurants will also reimburse your gate pass if you spend over a certain amount.", "Explore by bike With more than 60 miles of trails, Hilton Head is a bicyclist's dream. Not to mention, you can cut gas costs by biking around the island. You can rent a bike for around $60 to $75 a week.", "Visit in early fall Once Labor Day passes, the crowds that plagued Hilton Head during the summer disappear, meaning you're more likely to score lower hotel rates. Plus, the Atlantic Ocean is still warm enough for swimming.", "Consider a vacation rental The many luxurious accommodations that dot Hilton Head Island can get very expensive if you stay for more than a few days. Consider opting for a vacation rental to cut costs. You could also prepare your own meals if you rent a house, saving money on dining too. Vacation rental companies often throw in free bike rentals or offer large discounts on shoulder season weeks. Competition is fierce, so most vacation rental homes are well equipped, and upgraded.", "Most travelers are impressed by the dense greenery and lush parks found on Hilton Head Island, and they have some eco-conscious residents to thank for that. In the 1960s, when Sea Pines founder, Charles E. Fraser, was planning the first resort community on Hilton Head Island, developers around the country were razing wildlife to the ground, clear-cutting forests, to erect high-rises in places like Miami and Las Vegas. Fraser knew the intrinsic value of eco-friendly development long before it was in vogue. Hilton Head has very strict building codes to this day; no building can be higher than five stories, and tree removal requires town inspections and permissions. Islanders are very proud of the eco-friendly approach to development and recreation. Animals like alligators, birds, sea turtles, sand dollars, dolphins and horseshoe crabs are all protected and fiercely defended by residents. Visitors are expected to adhere to the rules of conduct with regards to wildlife. This focus on the environment is an extraordinary aspect of a Hilton Head vacation and is a main feature that sets the island apart from many traditional vacation spots.", "While in Hilton Head, there are two dining experiences you absolutely cannot forgo. First, dine on as much Lowcountry cuisine as you can. Second, make sure you do so alongside the water. Every marina and dock boasts at least two to four restaurants and casual grills that offer gorgeous views and Old Bay-seasoned Lowcountry boil, which is a tasty m\u00e9lange of Cajun-spiced shrimp, kielbasa sausage, corn on the cob and redskin potatoes. Or, take advantage of the area\u2019s love of fresh oysters, crab legs, and shrimp and grits. The Lowcountry cuisine's identity is based entirely on the bounty of the coast, which technically stretches 80 miles from the Savannah River in Georgia to Pawleys Island in South Carolina. Seafood reigns supreme, by default, as well as grits and rice, which, due to the climate, flourishes in the surrounding region.", "Many visitors may be surprised by the number of fine dining restaurants featuring authentic international cuisine. Hilton Head is now known for excellent Italian, French and Mexican restaurants.", "The best way to get around Hilton Head is by car and bike. Hilton Head is small (only 42 square miles), so you don't need to travel too far to get from one part of the island to the other (it takes about a half-hour by car). And with more than 60 miles of bike-friendly trails that weave through the island, you may find that you won't need your car all that much to begin with. Keep in mind that there is little to no public transportation on the island of Hilton Head. If you're staying at a resort, it will likely offer an area shuttle, otherwise, there's the seasonal Breeze trolley service.", "Hilton Head Island Airport (HHH) is the main airport that services Hilton Head. While this is the closest airport to Hilton Head's resorts, it offers a limited flight schedule. Many travelers fly into Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV), which sits about 45 miles south of Hilton Head. From there, travelers usually opt to rent a car, hire a taxi or take a ride-hailing service, such as a Lyft or Uber, to get to the island.", "Hilton Head's Harbour Town district, a pocket inside the island's gated Sea Pines resort community, is home to the iconic candy cane-striped lighthouse you've likely seen splashed across the island's postcards."]}
