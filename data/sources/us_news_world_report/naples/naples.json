{"name": "Naples", "description": ["Named after the coastal Italian city, Naples, Florida, is known for its laid-back ambiance, understated luxury, world-class golf \u2013 and pickleball. Though Florida's version doesn't have the history, sights or artwork of its Italian namesake, its extravagance mimics that of European watering holes along the Mediterranean. Instead of archaeological treasures and classical art, you'll find high-end restaurants and first-class hotels. With gently lapping waves on the white-sand beaches of southwest Florida's Gulf Coast, America's Napoli qualifies as one of the most relaxing and romantic beach destinations in the States. That said, party animals will probably want to seek other options, because Naples doesn't have many of the distractions (oops, we mean attractions) they are looking for. Relaxation is the name of the game here, with ample opportunities to explore the natural wonders that make this part of Florida a top destination for ecotourism.", "The best time to visit Naples is between March and June. Daytime temperatures hover in the 80s \u2013 perfect weather for the beach, the links or the pickleball courts. More importantly, if you visit during this sweet spot, you'll sidestep the \"season\" price hikes that start in November. Despite the exorbitant costs, winter is peak season here thanks to high average temps in the mid-70s. Peak summer is another busy time in Naples (blame the school calendar), but 90s with high humidity, even at the beach, gets uncomfortable. Naples' early autumn features a 10-degree slide into winter and with it a brief decline of hotel rates and crowds until the \"snowbirds\" return in November.", "You'll want to keep an eye on the weather forecast if you plan a visit anytime between June and November, which is Atlantic hurricane season. In September 2022, Hurricane Ian caused severe flooding in Naples and partially destroyed its iconic pier.", "It's ritzy You may have heard that Naples is \"ritzy,\" but just how ritzy is it? Composed of only 16 square miles, this compact city has two Ritz-Carlton resorts about 4 miles apart. Starting to get the picture?", "It's stylish Naples has its own 'beach chic\" style, with an emphasis on plenty of color and casual elegance. If you would like to blend in, don Lilly Pulitzer prints and shirts with the tiny, iconic polo player.", "It's tiny Old Naples, where many of the best restaurants and shops are located, is small enough that you might only need an afternoon to explore the whole town before heading back to the beach for one of the legendary sunsets.", "Choose a hotel Naples' hotels are normally cheaper than its resorts, and with so many public beaches, it should be easy to find a hotel that's near the shoreline.", "Find a rental If you're staying for more than a weekend and you brought the kids, consider a vacation rental instead of a hotel. Note that most vacation rental homes, however, are set away from the beach.", "Go exploring Although most visitors spend their time cloistered at their resort or on the greens, Naples has an abundance of natural sights to experience, many of which are free to explore. ", "Some say that Naples has the best cuisine of Florida's western shore. And quality doesn't come cheap. It should come as no surprise that this city by the water has a hankering for seafood; menus are filled with shrimp dishes and large stone-crab claws during season. Standouts include Nemo, Sea Monkey Tavern and Grill and Seventh South Craft Food and Drink, while families might find Pinchers at Tin City fun and save a bit, too: kids 13 and younger get a free entree with purchase of an adult entree. The most expensive restaurants are in the downtown area, but one of the great things about Naples is that great food \u2013 and not just seafood \u2013 can be found in just about every neighborhood.", "Those looking for something a little less damaging to the wallet will find a handful of chains dotting the area as well. If you're on a budget, you'll find the largest selection of eateries away from Old Naples and Fifth Avenue South, including in retail enclaves, such as the Pavilion, Waterside Shops and Mercato.", "The best way to get around Naples is by car, which is the best means for you to adopt the local \"three-stop routine\" \u2013 shops and restaurants, the beach and your hotel. Old Naples, the downtown area that contains many art galleries, shops and restaurants, is easy to navigate on foot or by car because the streets are on a grid. Naples Trolley Tours offers hop-on, hop-off transportation between downtown and Vanderbilt Beach, but the trolley is more for sightseeing with the drivers providing narration along the route. Travelers usually reach the city by flying through Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW), located in Fort Myers. From there, they take a cab or a rental the 35 miles into town."]}
