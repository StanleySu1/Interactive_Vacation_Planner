{"name": "Richmond", "description": ["Richmond is definitely a paradox. American history buffs celebrate it as a pivotal city in our nation's 18th-century fight for independence and our 19th-century fight to remain unified. But 21st-century Richmond is populated with college students (both Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Richmond call the city home), hipsters and young families. You can step back in time at St. John's Church, where re-enactors perform Patrick Henry's infamous, \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" speech. Or take a tour of the Virginia State Capitol to see how the city's past continues to shape its future.", "And when you're ready to return to the present, you'll find that Richmond is also home to boutique-y shopping areas (check out Carytown), quirky coffee shops and bars, and sophisticated martini lounges, and art galleries. So please, embrace both sides of this capital city's coin; spend a few days exploring the history and a few nights uncovering its burgeoning social scene.", "The best time to visit Richmond is from April through June. Not only will you experience pleasant temperatures, but you'll also encounter few crowds as area colleges wind down for the summer. Fall is another great time to visit as the city is brimming with fall colors, and sampling local fall-themed beverages (both beers and coffees) is a great way to pass an afternoon. Winter can be a nice time to visit, particularly during the holidays when the city is aglow in Christmas lights. Visiting in the summer means battling other tourists and Virginia's muggy weather. ", "There's a lot more than history Richmond is considered one of America's most historic destinations, but it also boasts plenty of outdoor adventure. Hike, bike, climb or fish on Belle Isle or head to the James River for some kayaking, paddleboarding or guided rafting trips from Riverside Outfitters.

What they find on arrival, however, is a city bursting with American favorites and international cuisine.", "Richmond's Black community has made an indelible mark on the city's culinary scene. Croaker's Spot, named for beloved Richmond local and food connoisseur Mr. Croaker, is a local institution serving up hearty seafood helpings enjoyed by locals and visitors alike. Shrimps and Jackie's Restaurant are two other favorites for Southern cooking and soul food. Addis, an Ethiopian restaurant, is another favorite.

In this area, you'll find several breweries within walking distance of one another, including The Veil Brewing Co. and V\u00e4sen Brewing. Luckily for those on a gluten-free diet, Scott's Addition also boasts a few different cideries.", "The best ways to get around Richmond are by bike, on foot and via the GRTC Pulse.
