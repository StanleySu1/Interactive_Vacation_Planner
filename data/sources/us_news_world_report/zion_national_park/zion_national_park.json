{"name": "Zion National Park", "description": ["Named for the Hebrew word \"refuge,\" Zion National Park \u2013 nestled in Utah's southwest corner \u2013 is no longer the quiet sanctuary it once was. The park is now one of the most visited in the country, welcoming more than 4 million visitors per year. It's as if travelers stumbled upon a secret and can't get enough of the apricot-colored Zion Canyon, which they can view wading through its Virgin River or ascending Angels Landing, with each bend in the river or turn in the trail affording an even more breathtaking view. Plus, the blanket of stars that illuminates the night sky is a welcome nightcap to a day filled with active pursuits. And when it's time to come back from the refuge to reality, the 166-mile drive from Las Vegas or the 308-mile drive from Salt Lake City is just about the right amount of time to process all the beauty you just experienced.", "The best time to visit Zion National Park is between the months of April and November when the park's free shuttles are running and the weather is comfortable. December through February constitutes the park's low season, but although there will be fewer crowds, some attractions, such as the Narrows and Angels Landing, might be too cold to fully enjoy. The park is open to the public 24 hours a day, every day of the year. It's important to know that because of Zion's immense popularity, crowds are common year-round. ", "Flash floods happen Before and during your time in Zion, keep a very close eye on the percipitation forecast. The canyon can fill with flash floods, and the hiking trails can become dangerous during storms.", "Parking here is very difficult Zion Canyon Scenic Drive is closed to private vehicles from March to November. Not only that, but  parking spaces typically fill by 8 or 9 a.m.", "You will experience crowds The National Park Service warns visitors that due to Zion's immense popularity, the park is always busy. As such, plan your vacation around the low and early shoulder reasons to avoid rubbing elbows with hordes of tourists. ", "You'll need a permit to hike Angels Landing Starting in 2022, any visitor who wants to hike the famous Angels Landing must apply for a permit via lottery on Recreation.gov. ", "Pitch a tent Save money on accommodations by camping at one of the park's three campgrounds. But plan to make a reservation several months in advance to ensure your spot.", "Stay in Springdale If you're not willing to rough it, bedding down in Springdale \u2013 the closest town that sits just outside the park's west entrance \u2013 may be your best bet. It's home to a variety of accommodations and also operates a free shuttle to the park. If you're willing to drive a bit farther, you may be able to score even cheaper accommodations in Hurricane, Utah.", "Zion National Park isn't known for its plethora of dining options. Inside the park, travelers can enjoy lunch or dinner at the Red Rock Grill, or coffee, snacks and french fries at the Castle Dome Caf\u00e9. Both are located within Zion Lodge.", "In neighboring Springdale, there are a few more options. Deep Creek Coffee Co., which serves coffee, as well as breakfast and lunch, is a favorite spot. Recent travelers also highlight breakfast joints like Caf\u00e9 Soleil Zion and the Spotted Dog Caf\u00e9.", "For more options, consider making the drive west to St. George. The Painted Pony \u2013 which serves up fine dining plates in a Southwestern-style, art-filled space \u2013 and Cliffside Restaurant \u2013 where panoramic views of the city and surrounding canyons are served alongside upscale American fare \u2013 are two of St. George's more popular restaurants.", "If you want to pick up snacks for the hiking trails, you might want to stock up in places like Las Vegas, Salt Lake City or St. George \u2013 depending on where you're traveling from \u2013 since there aren't any major chain grocery stores in this part of rural Utah. However, the town of Springdale does boast a local supermarket, Sol Foods.", "As with other national parks, Zion National Park is filled with awe-inspiring sights \u2013 from its Zion Canyon to its Virgin River \u2013 that can also pose as safety hazards if not approached appropriately. Keep an eye on the weather forecast and avoid hiking during thunderstorms, especially on trails such as the Narrows, which are predisposed to flash floods. Also, remember that summertime's high travel season \u2013 especially July through September \u2013 are particularly prone to heavy precipitation.", "Temperatures during the peak season reach into triple digits, which means that staying hydrated and wearing hats and sunscreen is very important. The National Park Service recommends carrying one gallon of water per person (per day) and bringing snacks. Do not drink any untreated water and avoid swimming in any of Zion's bodies of water. The reason for this has to do with possible cyanotoxin exposure; ingesting and exposing the skin to this toxin can lead to sickness and even death. ", "If any of your hiking companions become disoriented or confused \u2013 perhaps even have seizures \u2013 it's important to cool them down and seek medical attention immediately, as they could be experiencing heatstroke. Headaches, fatigue, clammy skin, nausea and vomiting are all symptoms of heat exhaustion and should be treated with food and fluids.", "Some of the hiking trails feature narrow areas with steep drop-offs \u2013 take your time, stay on the trails, keep away from the cliff edges, observe any posted warnings and keep a close eye on any children. For more information on staying safe in Zion National Park, visit the park service website.", "The best way to get around Zion National Park is on the park's free shuttle during the nine months of the year that it runs. Between December and February, your only option is a car since the shuttle pauses service during the winter months. If you choose to drive into the park, you'll have to pay a $35 entrance fee, which is valid for seven days. If you enter as a pedestrian or bicyclist (or via the free shuttle from the neighboring town of Springdale), you'll be required to pay $20.", "The closest major airport is Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) in Las Vegas. It's about 172 miles (or about a three-hour drive) southwest of the park. There are also two regional airports in St. George and Cedar City, Utah, but their flight options are limited."]}
