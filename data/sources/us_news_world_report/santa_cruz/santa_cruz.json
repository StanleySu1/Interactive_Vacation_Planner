{"name": "Santa Cruz", "description": ["This county in northern California is filled with an eclectic bunch of University of California, Santa Cruz students, Silicon Valley tycoons, surfing enthusiasts and left-leaning residents. Its landscape is just as varied, with Pacific Ocean waves crashing against rugged cliffs, redwood trees rising sky-high in nearby forests and the Santa Cruz Mountains looming above it all. ", "The area retains some of its offbeat charms like Mystery Spot and its old-timey attractions like the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, but the county's steady development of new local shops and restaurants speaks to its relevance today. Nowadays, Santa Cruz has enough things to do and places to eat to fill an entire vacation, but its location \u2013 just 75 miles south of San Francisco and 35 miles southwest of San Jose \u2013 makes it a great spot for a daytrip, too. ", "The best time to visit Santa Cruz is from September through November when the summer tourists have returned home, leaving a bit more room on the beaches, walking paths and other attractions. December, January and February see a slight dip in temperatures, which nonetheless are warm enough for the monarch butterflies who overwinter at Natural Bridges State Beach. The months between April and May are characterized by mounting temperatures and special events that meet their nexus in June, July and August. ", "Surf's up Santa Cruz is steeped in surf history. Much of the cult film favorite \"The Lost Boys\" was filmed here, and surfers still ride the waves in places like Steamer Lane.", "Wetsuits required O'Neill Wetsuits, which is headquartered in Santa Cruz, invented the wetsuit, and you'll likely need one if you're spending time in the cold Pacific waters.", "Be prepared for traffic Whether it's people traveling to the beach from San Jose on Highway 17 or others making the scenic drive on Highway 1, gridlock is inevitable.", "Catch a nature show You can certainly pay to see marine animals up close at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, but if you keep your eyes peeled, you'll spot plenty of animals around Santa Cruz without having to fork over a dime. Sea lions are known to frequent the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf and more than 220 species of birds call the Wetlands of Watsonville home.", "Soak up the rays Santa Cruz boasts 29 miles of coastline. Capitola, Rio del Mar, Twin Lakes, Seabright and Main beaches are among the shorelines that are free to access.", "The cuisine in Santa Cruz is as varied as the county's geography.

To get your caffeine fix, head to Verve Coffee Roasters, a highly acclaimed coffee bar and roaster with other locations in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo. Linda's Seabreeze Cafe is good spot for breakfast \u2013 try the cinnamon rolls \u2013 but remember to bring cash, as it does not accept cards.

", "The best way to get around Santa Cruz is by a combination of driving and walking. Santa Cruz is far too large to get around on foot alone, but a mix of walking and driving gives you the flexibility to see the county on your own terms. The county's public bus system is an option too, especially if you don't want to deal with highway traffic or parking fees.
