{"name": "Indianapolis", "description": ["With four major interstates passing through its city limits, all roads seem to lead to Indianapolis. It's connected to the Midwest mainstays of Chicago and St. Louis, after all. When compared to its neighbors, Indiana's capital doesn't initially stand out as a hotbed of culture. But if you look closer, you'll find that Kurt Vonnegut's hometown is just as vibrant as its Midwestern siblings. For starters, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is home to the Indianapolis 500, which, along with the Monaco Grand Prix and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, comprise the prestigious Triple Crown of Motorsport. Not much of a speed demon?

Maybe the Hoosier hospitality and comforting Midwestern fare will help change your mind.", "The best time to visit Indianapolis is between May and August for the pleasant weather (averages in mid-80s) and a plethora of outdoor events, like the iconic Indianapolis 500. December is another festive time when downtown Indy twinkles for the holidays (if you like winter weather). Pull out the sweaters and explore Indy in September and October for fall colors, Oktoberfest celebrations and everything orange, from the pumpkins to the trees. Indianapolis gets bitter cold and quiet as soon as the New Year's celebrations end.", "Avoid Memorial Day Unless you're in town for the Indianapolis 500, which always takes place over Memorial Day, you'll want to plan your Indy visit for another weekend. Flights and hotel rates will be pricey thanks to all the race traffic; budget travelers beware.", "Dial into its live music Indianapolis is home to a vibrant nightlife scene, especially live, local music. Try Slippery Noodle Inn, Indiana\u2019s oldest continuingly operating bar in its original location.", "You don't need a rental car Another pro for Indianapolis: The city is very walkable, especially the downtown area, where you'll probably spend most of your time.

Indy's dining scene has greatly evolved over the past decade and is quickly becoming a city foodies will relish exploring. Whether you're looking for farm-to-table, Cajun, Italian, Thai, Latin or anything in between, you'll likely find it.", "For breakfast, locals and critics recommend you start at Cafe Patachou with one of its cooked-to-order omelets. When lunchtime rolls around, you'll have your pick of casual eateries, but Shapiro's Delicatessen (get the pastrami sandwich with a side of the matzo ball soup) and Yats (don't pass up the chili cheese \u00e9touff\u00e9e with crawfish) are Hoosier favorites.", "If you're not in the mood for a steak dinner, grab an outdoor table at Mama Carolla\u2019s Old Italian Restaurant and see why locals consider it one of the most romantic places to eat.", "Bluebeard (which borrows its moniker from Kurt Vonnegut's novel of the same name) is another favorite among locals and visitors.
