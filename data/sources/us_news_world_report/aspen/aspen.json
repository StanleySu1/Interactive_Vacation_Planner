{"description": ["In terms of winter wonderland status, few destinations can compare to Aspen. This scenic mountain town is straight out of a snow globe, featuring picturesque mountain chalets hugged by the soaring Colorado Rockies. Of course, the main draw here is skiing and there are four premier ski areas nearby that cater to powder hounds of all levels. It's also a great jumping off point for some of the best Colorado snowmobile tours. But there's more to Aspen than winter sports: With high-end shopping, fascinating museums, funky galleries and fun festivals, it might be a struggle to make it to the slopes. No matter how you choose to spend your time here, it will be a vacation you'll never forget.", "For several decades now, this village has been the diamond in the Roaring Fork Valley, and we're not just talking figuratively. This small ski town has long been a respite for the rich and famous, with high-end resorts like The Little Nell and Viceroy Snowmass luring celebs with the promise of luxurious privacy. But don't let the possibility of sticker shock keep you away; instead, you can offset the high cost of deluxe lodging by simply enjoying your surroundings. Some of Aspen's most popular sites \u2013 like Maroon Bells \u2013 come to us from Mother Earth, who doesn't charge admirers a cent.", "The best time to visit Aspen is from December to February. The town sparkles when it's buried under fresh powder, and its slopes are ready to be taken by storm. Keep in mind that this is the most popular time to visit, so prices will likely be elevated, but you can find some deals if you plan a few months in advance. The ski season typically runs from late November to mid-April. You'll find the lowest prices on lift tickets at the beginning or end of the season, with the highest prices around the Christmas holidays and the month of January. ", "Aspen's second high season occurs between June and August, with temperatures in the high 70s \u2013 the perfect atmosphere for a mountain hike. To save money, consider visiting in the spring or fall, making sure to plan a few weeks ahead to secure a hotel that's open in the offseason.", "Take care to avoid altitude sickness Those who aren't used to being nearly 8,000 feet above sea level may experience dizziness, nausea and may have difficulty breathing \u2013 all signs of altitude sickness. Make sure to take it easy the first day or two of your visit and avoid drinking alcohol.", "Plan for shoulder season closures Because Aspen primarily welcomes skiers and hikers, hotels sometimes close for a few weeks during the spring and fall seasons. However, you should be able to find lower lodging rates during this time.", "Beware the backcountry Unless you're a very experienced skier, it's a good idea to stick to designated areas since avalanches do happen. Before you head out, check the avalanche forecast from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.", "Go for the package deals Stay-and-ski deals offered by local hotels are the best ways to get the most bang for your buck. Many include free nights, free lift tickets and discounts on food.", "Opt for the bus Renting a car in Aspen is an unnecessary expense as well as a hassle. Instead, rely on the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority's free service around town and to Snowmass. Even if you go beyond the free zone, prices are still very reasonable.", "Book early Purchasing lift tickets and renting equipment online in advance can save you up to 45% in ski resort costs. It'll also keep you from wasting valuable time waiting in line.", "Aspen is home to one of the world's premier culinary festivals (the Food & Wine Classic in Aspen held every summer), so it should be no surprise that this ski town boasts a plethora of dining and drinking options. If you're a self-proclaimed foodie, you may want to splurge for a ticket to the festival to sample the wine and food and attend seminars with celebrity chefs, master sommeliers and more. If you're not looking to spend a small fortune, but still seeking an upscale (and quality) meal, residents and visitors alike have positive things to say about Japanese eatery and sushi haven Matsuhisa, snack- and sandwich-centric The White House Tavern, rustic farm shop-meets-restaurant Meat & Cheese, and the unpretentious hotel hot spot Ajax Tavern (located in The Little Nell). More casual eateries include Zocalito (lauded for its Latin cuisine and creative cocktails) and beloved lunch spot Grateful Deli.", "And then there's apr\u00e8s-ski. After a long day of shredding the slopes, what better way to kick back and relax than with some apr\u00e8s-ski (aka happy hour) drinks and snacks? Spots like Ajax Tavern, the W Aspen, J Bar at the Hotel Jerome and Cloud Nine Alpine Bistro win favor with locals and travelers for their mix of affordable specials, fun vibes and live music. And if you're looking to sample the local craft beer, head to the Aspen Brewing Company.", "The best way to get around Aspen is on foot or by bus. Bringing your own car will prove to be a headache, particularly with the limited parking and the challenges of driving in winter weather. Instead, consider getting acquainted with the town on foot. When it comes to getting to and from the slopes, the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) has you covered, offering regular and affordable service to the major ski areas (the ride from Aspen to Snowmass is free). RFTA also provides free service throughout central Aspen and to Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, which is located less than 5 miles northwest of downtown Aspen.", "If you\u2019re flying into Denver International Airport (DEN), you can rent a car at the airport and make the approximately 225-mile journey yourself. From Denver, take I-70 to Aspen's Route 82, the town's main thoroughfare."]}
