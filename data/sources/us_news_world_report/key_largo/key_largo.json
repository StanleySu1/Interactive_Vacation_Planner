{"name": "Key Largo", "description": ["In Key Largo, relaxation is the name of the game. The closest of the Keys to mainland Florida, this laid-back haven is a swift departure from the party atmosphere of Key West. Here, vacationers seeking some rest and recuperation can spend their days picnicking on the beach, admiring resident manatees from the docks of their rental homes or taking a slow canal cruise on the African Queen. Outdoorsy types will be equally happy here, as the expansive, activity-filled wetlands of Everglades National Park are just a short drive away. Even closer is John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, where travelers can snorkel and scuba dive among a diverse underwater ecosystem. In fact, as the self-proclaimed \"Dive Capital of the World,\" Key Largo offers a number of intricate sites that attract divers year-round. But no matter how you choose to spend your days, it would be a shame not to end them with as many fresh lobster dinners and killer Key Largo sunsets as possible. ", "The best time to visit Key Largo is between December and March. During this time, you will find dry weather and temperatures that aren't too hot, but are still warm enough for the beach and other outdoor activities. During the holiday season, Key Largo hosts fun celebrations like an annual cook-off and a holiday boat parade, while January welcomes two popular food festivals. Temperatures in April and May remain comfortable in the 70s and 80s, and it is a fairly quiet time to visit. June through November brings hot summer temperatures reaching the 90s and hurricane season, but also fewer crowds and lower hotel rates."]}
