{"name": "Fort Myers", "description": ["This southwest Florida vacation spot may be quieter than its party neighbors on the eastern side of the state, but it's no less interesting. In Fort Myers, the hustle and bustle you'll find in cities like Miami is replaced by family-friendly beaches and historic homes \u2013 like the Edison & Ford Winter Estates. Both historic figures are credited with transforming Fort Myers into the lush hideaway it is today.", "Nature is important in this city, too: dozens of wildlife and nature preserves are scattered throughout the area, including J.N. \"Ding\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge, which is part of the largest undeveloped mangrove system in the U.S. The Fort Myers area boasts nearly 20 beaches, ranging from easily accessible to a few that are only accessible by boat. Another big draw to Fort Myers: spring training. Two major league baseball teams (the Boston Red Sox and the Minnesota Twins) flock to the warmer weather to practice while diehard fans get a first glimpse at the upcoming lineup. With such a diverse offering, it's easy to see why the \"City of Palms\" rivals its larger neighbors in South Florida. ", "The best time to visit Fort Myers is mid-January through April for those looking to escape the cold climates for warmer temperatures. During this timeframe you can expect higher hotel rates and more people, especially during spring training in March, but the weather will be well worth it. If you're planning to travel around this this time of year you'll want to be sure and book accommodations at least three months in advance. Hotel rates dip during the low season, except around holidays.", "It's still recovering Hurricane Ian hit Fort Myers hard in 2022. The city is open and welcoming visitors. When it comes to the area beaches, keep in mind that some may look different and have limited amenities. You'll also want to check beach conditions before picking a beach to visit", "The beach is a trek Despite its name, Fort Myers Beach is actually located on Estero Island, about 15 miles south of downtown. That's roughly a 30- to 40-minute drive (or more, with traffic), so be sure to plan accordingly.", "Don't miss the trees Making for a grand entrance into the \"City of Palms,\" McGregor Boulevard is lined with about 1,800 palm trees and historic homes for miles.", "There are islands nearby In addition to the city, the region immediately surrounding Fort Myers includes myriad islands, some of which are uninhabited and others that serve as exclusive hideaways. You can rent a boat, take a ferry or join an island-hopping tour to catch a glimpse. Alternatively, head to Sanibel Island or Estero Island for a beachy day trip.", "Camp out This area is home to several campgrounds and RV parks, such as Koreshan State Park, where you can cut accommodation costs while increasing your time in the incredible climate.", "Like many other Florida beach destinations, Fort Myers is a relaxed place with friendly residents. But keep in mind that a little politeness goes a long way, and it's important to remember proper etiquette. Downtown Fort Myers is about 15 miles from the closest beach, so keep the swimsuits just for the shore. Shorts, T-shirts, summer dresses and flip flops are widely accepted, although you may want to pack nicer clothes if splurging for a fancy dinner out. A light sweater or jacket is a good idea, too, for indoor spots cooled by air conditioning.", "From waterside spots to fine dining establishments, you'll be spoiled for choice when it comes to deciding where to enjoy breakfast, lunch, dinner and bites in between. That's not to say that all appetites aren't satiated in Fort Myers, though \u2013 you'll find steakhouses and cafes, plus vegan and vegetarian dishes throughout the city's neighborhoods. In the River District, pop into tea houses or coffee bars, sidle up to a sidewalk cafe, order a pint at a craft brewery or keep the conversation going over a candlelit table.", "If you like seafood, you've come to the right place. Stone crabs are a Florida delicacy, so when they're in season (October 15 to May 15) be sure to get your hands on some for a taste of one of the most sustainable seafood options available. Of course, there's always fresh-off-the-boat fish year-round.", "The best way to get around Fort Myers is by car. With the closest beach about 15 miles south of downtown, a car will facilitate your fun \u2013 plus, the alternatives may give you a headache. The available public transportation has a reputation for being inconvenient and unreliable. Aside from the River District, travelers say it's not easy to walk around due to the distance between attractions. To get into town, many visitors fly into Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW), located about 16 miles southeast of the city center."]}
