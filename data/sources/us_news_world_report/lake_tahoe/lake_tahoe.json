{"name": "Lake Tahoe", "description": ["Incredible, extraordinary, mind-boggling \u2026 try as you might, you'll have difficulty finding words that do justice to the sheer beauty of Lake Tahoe. Resting on the California-Nevada border, Lake Tahoe has long been a favorite vacation spot, welcoming about 15 million visitors each year. Travelers are drawn here by the steep granite cliff sides and towering mountaintops, as well as the crystal-clear waters that have earned Lake Tahoe the reputation of being one of the most beautiful bodies of water in the United States. While the stunning blue lake alone is worth a trip, the surrounding area, also known as Lake Tahoe, boasts miles of hiking trails, dozens of picture-perfect vistas and some of the best skiing in North America.", "But wait \u2013 there's more. Lake Tahoe seems to have adopted the major traits of its neighbors. You'll find San Francisco-style high-end shopping and dining along the lake's north shore, while opportunities to test your luck reside in the south shore's Reno-esque casinos. You'll also find plenty of activities that Lake Tahoe is proud to take credit for, including mountain gondola rides, hot air balloon adventures and scenic cruises across the mirror-like water.", "The best times to visit Lake Tahoe are from March to May and from September to November, but the area welcomes visitors throughout the year thanks to the wide variety of attractions and activities. With warmer weather comes beachcombers: In July and August, Tahoe's shores are lined with oversized umbrellas and sun-drenched kids. There's a small break in tourist activity during the fall, but as the temperatures decline, visitors re-emerge with skis in hand, ready to tackle the powder. Traveling in early March or early to mid-November specifically will allow you to experience the area at a fraction of the price.", "It's big This massive lake spans almost 200 square miles.
