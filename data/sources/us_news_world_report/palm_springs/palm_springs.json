{"name": "Palm Springs", "description": ["This desert oasis first lured Hollywood stars in the 1920s for film shoots and weekends away. Frank Sinatra was a regular, and rock 'n' roll legend Elvis Presley even took up residence here in the late 1960s, honeymooning with Priscilla. Today, Palm Springs is still a hub of midcentury modern architecture \u2013 some former celebrity homes are even vacation rentals. Its pools, spas and restaurants, many with outdoor seating, attract a wide swath of visitors, from families to LGBTQ travelers. Plus, the surrounding Coachella Valley has blossomed with interesting things to do, from The Living Desert Zoo and Gardens in nearby Palm Desert, to the Coachella Valley Preserve with its lush oasis of palm-lined hiking trails. ", "What's more, the colorful sunsets rival those on the coast, and the magnificent desert scenery, where snowcapped mountain ridges mingle with springtime superblooms, should not be missed. But if you want a true Palm Springs experience, you should take it easy, whether by the pool or in a trendy bar. Palm Springs passed muster for Hollywood\u2019s stars, and still delivers on a great mix of fun and relaxation for today\u2019s travelers.", "The best time to visit Palm Springs is between November and April when the weather is the most hospitable, though January is when the true high season begins thanks to a variety of notable events that draw large crowds. Remember: The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Stagecoach Festival are both popular events held each April, and as a result, hotel prices are often at their highest at this time. Fall's temperatures are almost as nice, but unless you love the heat, we wouldn't recommend visiting in the summertime when daily highs regularly reach the triple digits.", "You're in the desert If you plan on exploring, whether that's through hiking, mountain biking or riding all-terrain vehicles, bring a travel companion and plenty of water to ensure you don\u2019t risk dehydration or getting lost. You'll also want to to keep an eye out for poisonous snakes and wild animals.", "Summer brings closures Some restaurants and attractions shut down or limit their hours in July and August due to the uncomfortable heat and fewer crowds.", "Visit in July, August or September You'll be sweating thanks to the triple-digit temps, but you'll also save money on hotels as properties list their cheapest rates of the year, and some restaurants offer deals to entice diners.", "Plan a midweek trip In the busy winter and early spring, many hotels and resorts boost their rates on the weekends when crowds swell for the great weather, golf and tennis tournaments, and music festivals, so plan the bulk of your visit between Monday and Thursday for the best prices.", "Enjoy the freebies Each Thursday, Palm Canyon Drive shuts down to vehicular traffic for VillageFest, a free street fair with craft vendors, food trucks and live music.", "Choose from authentic Mexican eateries, California-inspired farm-to-table fare, lively brunch spots with expansive outdoor patios, and global cuisines ranging from French to Eastern European and Japanese. ", "Most of these establishments are huddled together in the downtown area on North and South Palm Canyon and Indian Canyon drives between East Vista Chino and Ramon Road. Options tend to lean a bit more touristy toward the bottom end, but there are good options throughout. Many top-tier restaurants are also found inside Palm Springs\u2019 coolest hotels, which are found near the same corridor and extend south to Highway 111.", "You can also pick up fresh, seasonal produce, meats and more at the Coachella Valley Certified Farmers' Market, which is hosted every Saturday morning at the Palm Springs Cultural Center parking lot (outdoors from October to May) or the Palm Springs Pavilion (indoors between June and September).", "The best way to get around Palm Springs is by car. Although you can walk most places downtown, you'll need your own set of wheels to explore the rest of the Coachella Valley. You can also take the bus to reach certain destinations throughout the city and beyond, or you can always hire a taxi or ride-hailing service. The easiest way to get from Palm Springs International Airport (PSP) \u2013 located 3 miles east of downtown Palm Springs \u2013 is to hop in a taxi, arrange a ride-hailing service or rent a car."]}
