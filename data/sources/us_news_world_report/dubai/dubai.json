{"name": "Dubai", "description": ["Dubai and Las Vegas have a lot in common. Both cities share a love for the fantastical, with skylines that shine like beacons against barren desert backdrops. People from all over the world flock to these shimmering oases with the same goal: to play hard. But as a vacation spot, Dubai easily trumps ol' Sin City thanks to its gorgeous cream-colored Persian Gulf shoreline (which in the UAE you'll see and hear referred to as the Arabian Gulf), international culinary scene and larger-than-life attractions. And the city's still growing; plans are always underway for something bigger and better. At one point, it was alleged that a quarter of the world's construction cranes could be found here. If that's any sign, even the sky may not be able to limit Dubai's growth.", "Dubai is a city of superlatives, home to the world's tallest tower, one of the world's largest shopping malls and one of the world's largest human-made marinas. On a smaller scale, this emirate is still tied to its days as a modest port town. Traditional wooden abras (boats) float past motorboats on Dubai Creek, the natural sands of Jumeirah's beaches look toward the carefully sculpted Palm Jumeirah and the bustling gold and spice souks (marketplaces) thrive amid the retro atmosphere of Dubai's Creekside neighborhoods. Despite constantly looking to the future, this city isn't quick to let go of its past. It's this dynamic that not only put Dubai on the tourist map, but will also keep it there.", "The best time to visit Dubai is from November to March. Weather-wise, Dubai really only experiences two seasons: hot and hotter. During the winter months, the city sees blue skies and primo beach weather. However, this is also peak tourist season, so expect plenty of company on Jumeirah's beaches. You can escape the crowds if you visit during the summer months, but be prepared for triple-digit temps and high humidity levels (it's only a \"dry\" heat in the winter).", "Visiting Dubai during Islamic holidays is a special experience, but note that dates for these holidays change annually, based on the lunar cycle. The major Islamic holidays in Dubai include the holy month of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice), Hijri (Islamic new year) and the Prophet Mohammad's birthday. An Islamic calendar can be found here, but it is important to understand that the exact date(s) may not be confirmed until a moon phase is sighted by the moon-sighting committee to call the official start of these holidays.", "Keep in mind: Islamic holidays may impact business hours during your trip. Hours may be shorter and the nightlife scene may also be a bit quieter compared to other months of the year. Between sunrise and sunset during Ramadan, Muslims do not eat, drink or smoke. The dates for Ramadan are variable since they follow the lunar calendar.", "You'll feel safe here Dubai is one of \u2014 if not the \u2014 safest destination in the Middle East. The city's population stems from countries across the globe, and everyone coexists peacefully.", "Fashion conscious Although some 75% of the UAE's residents are practicing Muslims, the multicultural and cosmopolitan attitude of Dubai means that in many places you can dress as you do in the U.S., although with a heightened sense of fashion.", "What not to wear You'll find conservative attire to be more the norm in older neighborhoods such as Deira and Bur Dubai. When visiting these areas or any religious sites such as a mosque, women should cover their knees and shoulders and men should wear trousers and a long-sleeve shirt.", "Too much sun can be a bad thing Dubai's visitors often fall in love with the city's warm, sunny climate. However, it can get really hot, and there aren't a lot of shady places in the middle of the desert. Lather on sunscreen, drink plenty of water and wear a hat.", "Plan in advance A trip to Dubai will be expensive. But you'll have a better chance at snagging a lower room rate if you make your hotel reservations two to three months in advance.", "Stay sober Alcohol is rarely served outside of restaurants and bars, where prices are about as high as the Burj Khalifa. You'll save big bucks if you skip the drinks.", "Dubai stands as one of seven emirates (akin to U.S. states) that make up the United Arab Emirates; the other six are Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. Each emirate is governed by a ruler from a hereditary Sheikhdom. The ruler of Abu Dhabi acts as president of the Federal Supreme Council (both the UAE's legislative and executive body), while the ruler of Dubai fills the role of vice president. Although Abu Dhabi serves as the official capital of the UAE, Dubai has long been the emirates' commercial and financial hub.", "Dubai's s role as a commercial heavyweight attracts expats from around the world. Its population features citizens of 200 different nationalities, and each has left its own imprint on daily life. However, the dominant religion here is Islam, and Muslim culture impacts Dubai's society. As a result, visitors are encouraged to be mindful of how they dress, particularly in more traditional parts of the country. Alcohol-licensed venues are more than plentiful, even outside of hotels. Those who visit during Ramadan (the Islamic month of fasting) are encouraged to refrain from eating or drinking in public places.", "Despite its size, Dubai has earned a reputation as being one of the safest places in the Middle East and women visiting should also feel safe to move about freely.", "Although the official language is Arabic, Dubai's trade history and booming tourism market means that almost everyone speaks English. American travelers can also rejoice in the fact that most major credit cards are accepted at stores, hotels and restaurants. For those paying in cash, the official currency here is the Emirati dirham (AED) with 1 dirham equal to $0.27. The dirham is pegged to the U.S. dollar, which means the rate does not fluctuate. Cards and digital wallets are accepted most places, but it's smart to have cash on hand when visiting Dubai's traditional souks (markets).", "Given the multicultural nature of Dubai you'll find a little bit of everything, although Levantine Middle Eastern fare and Indian cuisine are particularly ample thanks to the city's large Arab and Indian populations. That means you can expect lots of spice and flavor. If you're keen to try traditional Emirati dishes, look for chebab \u2013 Emirati pancakes infused with saffron and cardamom and topped with yogurt and date syrup \u2013 and harees \u2013 a porridge-like dish with meat often served during Ramadan. Arabic coffee (gahwa) is an experience in itself, especially for those who often take theirs with cream and sugar. This coffee features roasted beans mixed with cardamom. The ingredients are ground, boiled then strained into an intense brew and served in small cups.", "To find more traditional (and more affordable) cuisine, head to Dubai's older neighborhoods, like Deira, Bur Dubai and Satwa, for wide selections of restaurants, cafes, canteens and even walk-up windows serving authentic Indian curries, Arabic mezze, Iranian kebabs and the much-loved shawarma sandwich \u2013 a must-try. For something more glam \u2013 and potentially acclaimed, as Michelin started awarding stars to Dubai restaurants in 2022 \u2013 head to the restaurants in the city's top hotels you'll find high-end, sophisticated dining. Dubai International Financial Centre is a glam neighborhood buzzing with trendy, upscale restaurants. Take a stroll around Jumeirah Lakes Towers neighborhood, opposite Dubai Marina, for mid-range restaurants serving a wide variety of food, from Filipino to Greek.", "The best way to get around Dubai is by taxi or by metro. Although prices are high across the board in Dubai, a taxi here or there won't break the bank. Plus, they provide the freedom to move at your own pace without the hassle of navigating traffic. Dubai's metro system transports passengers to major areas of interest, including Burj Khalifa and the Dubai International Airport (DXB). The airport is about 8.5 miles from Downtown Dubai. You can also rent a car at the airport, but be forewarned: driving here is not for the faint-hearted.", "Americans visiting the United Arab Emirates do not require a tourist visa for visits less than 30 days, but must have an official U.S. passport that is valid for at least six months following your arrival date. Travelers must also possess a return ticket or other proof that they will be leaving the UAE within that 30-day timeframe. For visits exceeding 30 days, travelers must obtain a tourist visa prior to departure. Americans exiting the UAE by land transportation will be subject to a departure fee of 35 dirhams (about $9.50), payable only in local currency.
