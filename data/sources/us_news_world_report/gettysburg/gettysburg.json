{"name": "Gettysburg", "description": ["Whether you want to enjoy a romantic weekend away with your significant other or an educational vacation with your kids, Gettysburg has you covered. This charming small town in southern Pennsylvania is packed with mom and pop shops, cozy inns and restaurants that serve farm-to-table American cuisine and locally crafted drinks. But chances are you're visiting this East Coast locale to see its abundance of historic attractions. Known for its ties to the Civil War, Gettysburg is home to all kinds of historically significant sites, including Gettysburg National Military Park, where the war's bloodiest battle took place. To fully immerse yourself in the park's history, consider a guided tour of Gettysburg.", "Though you could easily spend the bulk of your trip exploring the park, be sure to save time for the Jennie Wade House and the Shriver House Museum, among other Civil War sites. And when you want to take a break from Gettysburg's dark past, wander around the Eisenhower National Historic Site or enjoy a photo-op at Sachs Covered Bridge. No matter how you choose to spend your vacation, you're bound to leave town feeling relaxed and more informed than you did prior to your arrival.", "The best time to visit Gettysburg is from September to November or between March and May. The town's daytime temperatures in fall and spring, which generally hover between the low 50s and high 70s, are cooler than what you'll encounter in June, July and August (Gettysburg's peak tourist season). As a result, hotel prices will drop and attraction crowds will thin \u2013 especially in November and March. September and October attract leaf peepers and those with an interest in the paranormal, while April and May see an influx of students in town for school field trips. Those who don't mind rubbing elbows with hordes of tourists and paying extra for accommodations should consider visiting between June and August, when outdoor concerts at local wineries and Civil War re-enactments take place.", "It's reportedly haunted Like other historic American cities (think: St. Augustine, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia), Gettysburg boasts several attractions that are considered hot spots for paranormal activity. To learn more about the town's spooky past, sign up for a ghost tour with an outfitter like Ghostly Images of Gettysburg or Gettysburg Ghost Tours.", "It's surrounded by farmland You'll find several orchards, farmers markets, vineyards and farm-to-table restaurants in and just outside of town.

These tiny critters can transmit Lyme disease if they're attached to you for at least 24 hours. To protect yourself from ticks, apply insect repellent with DEET regularly and wear pants and a long-sleeved shirt. Don't forget to check your clothes and skin frequently and to shower shortly after being outside. If you are bitten by a tick, immediately remove it with tweezers.

Though you'll need to use other modes of transportation to get to town, Gettysburg's small size makes it easy to walk to and from any point downtown. Parking is also readily available should you choose to drive. To visit nearby wineries, ski slopes, the Eisenhower National Historic Site or Sachs Covered Bridge, plan on bringing or renting a car. Other options include riding bikes or Freedom Transit trolleys, but their fees make them more expensive than walking or relying on your own set of wheels.", "Several airports \u2013 including those servicing Baltimore and Washington, D.C. \u2013 sit within 100 miles of Gettysburg, but the closest is Harrisburg International Airport (MDT), which is located about 45 miles northeast in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
