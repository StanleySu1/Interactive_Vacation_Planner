{"name": "Huntington Beach", "description": ["Though you may initially think of action-packed Los Angeles or kid-friendly San Diego when planning a trip to Southern California, few Golden State destinations are as quintessentially Californian as Huntington Beach. Unlike the upscale beach communities of Laguna Beach and Malibu, Huntington Beach embraces a laid-back vibe fitting of its Surf City USA nickname. In this coastal city between Newport Beach and Long Beach, you'll find 10 miles of beaches that draw sports enthusiasts, families and dog lovers in droves, plus a 1,400-acre ecological reserve and a downtown packed with restaurants, bars and hotels. So whether you've come to surf, play beach volleyball or simply relax with loved ones by a waterfront bonfire, Huntington Beach is the place to go.", "The best time to visit Huntington Beach is between September and November. Throughout these autumn months, you'll enjoy summer's warm weather without the peak season's thick crowds and high accommodation prices. Plus, some of the city's most popular events \u2013 including The Great Pacific Airshow and Surf City Surf Dog \u2013 occur during this time of year. However, you can't go wrong with a visit during other seasons. Excellent whale watching opportunities are available from December through April (winter and most of spring), while May (late spring) sees a return to highs in the 70s and a drop in rainfall, making it another great time to visit the beach. Once summer rolls around, you'll enjoy consistently superb beach weather (think: clear skies and pleasant temps), though you'll need to plan in advance to secure low room rates and a spot at the beach.", "Beach sports are big here While surfing is undoubtedly the city's main draw, other sports like beach volleyball and fishing are also popular. Don't be surprised to see locals \u2013 and occasionally, a pro or two \u2013 serving on the sand or casting a line from the Huntington Beach Pier.", "Each season comes with its own perks Summer features consistently clear skies and warm weather, making it the most popular time to visit. However, you'd be remiss if you didn't consider visiting during other seasons. Fall is when top annual events like The Great Pacific Airshow and the Surf City Surf Dog competition take place, while winter and spring are excellent times to go whale watching.", "Families are welcome Some California beaches cater to kids better than others, and one of the places that does this best is Huntington Beach. The city offers a variety of family-friendly amenities, from a skateboarding park to an equestrian center to resorts with children's activities. Plus, it's the closest beach to Anaheim, so families can easily take a daytrip to Disneyland Resort.", "Don't visit in summer Because June, July and August offer the best beach weather, they're the busiest and most expensive months of the year. If you want to still enjoy warm weather without overpaying for accommodations, arrive before or after the peak summer season (in May, September or October).", "Don't stay in an amenity-packed resort Huntington Beach's four oceanfront resorts are the city's priciest properties. To save some coin on accommodations, choose a spot with fewer frills, such as an inn or a motel. You'll even find a few beach campgrounds, should you decide to come in a recreational vehicle.
