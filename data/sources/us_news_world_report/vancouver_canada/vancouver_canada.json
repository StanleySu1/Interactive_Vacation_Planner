{"name": "Vancouver, Canada", "description": ["Even by North American standards, Vancouver is a young city (it was incorporated in 1886). But what it lacks in history it compensates for in culture. Experience Vancouver's Indigenous culture (including First Nations, Metis and Inuit people) in an array of historic sites, boutiques, and museums. The city's high-fashion boutiques and fondness for health-conscious eating make it an attractive urban playground. Plus, Vancouver and its breathtaking backdrop of mountains and beaches has been the setting for a bevy of popular television shows and major motion pictures (including \"Riverdale,\" \"X-Files\" and \"Deadpool\"), so don't be surprised if you recognize landmarks from your favorite scenes or stumble upon a production in progress.", "But this mitten-shaped city on Canada's western edge draws in more than pop culture junkies. Hiking, mountain biking, kayaking, whitewater rafting and skiing will beckon to your adventurous side (and are especially accessible on one of the best Vancouver tours). Looking for a little rest and relaxation? Try lounging along the 11 miles of beaches or in one of the numerous parks. During the cold weather, you can duck inside one of the top-notch museums or take the kids to one of the family-friendly attractions, like Granville Island or the Capilano Suspension Bridge. When you add excellent shopping, dining and nightlife scenes to the mix, you'll see why many praise Vancouver as a go-to getaway for the multifaceted traveler.", "The best times to visit Vancouver are from March to May and from September to November when the weather is mild and hotel rooms can be found at bargain rates. Summer is the most popular time thanks to the promise of warmer weather; however, if you're planning a trip then, make sure to reserve your hotel room at least two or three weeks in advance. If you're a winter sports fanatic, then don't let the biting temperatures deter you: This city makes a great home base for skiers and snowboarders looking to challenge the powder at Grouse Mountain or nearby Whistler. Regardless of when you visit, packing layers is a must to keep you comfortable.", "Bring comfy shoes Central Vancouver is ideal for walking. Forget the car and get to know this outdoorsy city on foot. Plus, you'll have to hoof it on several of the best Vancouver tours anyway.", "Pack a rain jacket You'll likely encounter an occasional rain shower no matter when you visit Vancouver.

Make sure to keep a close watch on your valuables.", "Travel during the shoulder seasons Summer and winter are both popular times to visit. If you're hoping to find some deals on hotels, consider planning a trip for the spring or fall.", "Fly into Seattle International flights tend to be more expensive.

Though English and French are the two official languages, you'll also likely hear Chinese, Punjabi, German, Italian, French, Tagalog (Filipino) and Spanish.", "Perhaps the biggest difference American travelers will encounter is the use of the Canadian dollar and the international metric system. One U.S. dollar is equal to about CA$1.30, but since the exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check it before your trip. You can avoid confusion by familiarizing yourself with Canadian currency. Coins are in denominations of $2, $1, $0.50, $0.25, $0.10 and $0.05. Canadian dollar coins are called \"loonies;\" two dollar coins are called \"toonies.\" Paper bills are in denominations of $100, $50, $20, $10 and $5.

Richmond is also home to the Richmond Night Market, the largest night market in North America that features more than 70 food stalls. ", "Aside from providing the city fresh regional ingredients, Vancouver's coastal location also provides a picturesque backdrop for many of the top restaurants. For dinner with a view, try the Teahouse in Stanley Park, Lift Bar Grill View or Cardero's Restaurant, to name only a few. For guidance from a local, sign up for a foodie tour (many of which are included on our list of the best Vancouver tours).", "Vancouver is a safe city to visit, however \"crimes of opportunity,\" such as pickpocketing and stealing valuables from unlocked cars, are common.
