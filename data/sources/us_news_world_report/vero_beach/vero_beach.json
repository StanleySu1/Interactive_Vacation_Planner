{"name": "Vero Beach", "description": ["If you're dreaming of a Florida beach vacation that offers ample opportunities to immerse yourself in nature, history and culture, Vero Beach is the destination for you. This small beach town on Florida's Treasure Coast features everything you need to relax your mind, body and spirit, fuel your passion for the arts and satisfy your curiosity about old Florida tales. Start your trip with a visit to the McLarty Treasure Museum to learn more about Vero's connection to one of the world's most legendary shipwrecks. Then, head to unspoiled sanctuaries like Sebastian Inlet State Park and Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge to surf world-renowned waves, look for unique wildlife (think: manatees and alligators) or simply soak up the stunning scenery. When you're in need of a dose of culture, make your way to Riverside Park, where two of Vero's best cultural attractions \u2013 Riverside Theatre and the Vero Beach Museum of Art \u2013 reside. Should you find yourself wanting to simply do nothing, go for a leisurely stroll on Ocean Drive or lounge by your resort's ocean-facing pool.", "The best time to visit Vero Beach is from March to May. During these spring months, you'll see Vero at its best. Daytime temperatures rarely climb above the mid-80s, rain showers are generally brief and crowds are manageable. Vero's best weather comes in December, January and February; however, winter is when you'll encounter the most snowbirds, so traffic is more common and prices for hotels and flights are typically higher. June, July and August are Vero's cheapest and quietest times to visit, but the threat of a hurricane and uncomfortable heat and humidity make summer worth avoiding. September, October and November also tend to be affordable while being slightly less humid, though September is Florida's most active month during the Atlantic hurricane season, so you'll want to buy travel insurance to protect your investment should a storm change your plans.", "There are two sides to the town While the part of Vero that sits on North Hutchinson Island features a more luxurious atmosphere thanks to its high-end hotels, chic boutiques, upscale restaurants and multimillion-dollar mansions, the mainland section of town provides a more approachable ambiance due to its variety of cost-effective, family-friendly attractions and eateries. Visit both areas to enjoy a well-rounded vacation.", "This is citrus country You may already know that Florida grows some of the country's best citrus \u2013 more than 90% of America's orange juice is made with the state's oranges \u2013 but did you know that Indian River County (where Vero is located) is considered one of the largest citrus producers in the state? To get an overview of the town's citrus history, visit the Indian River Citrus Museum at The Heritage Center or take a tour of the orange and grapefruit groves at Schacht Groves.", "Local is always best You'll find your fair share of chain restaurants and department stores here, but if you want to enjoy the town like a resident, head to its locally owned dining, drinking and shopping venues. A few local favorites include Ocean Grill, Riverside Caf\u00e9, Walking Tree Brewery, The Lazy Daisy Vero Beach and Sassy Boutique.", "It's a hidden gem for celebrities Though Vero's famous residents \u2013 including author Carl Hiaasen and musicians Gloria Estefan and Jake Owen \u2013 typically stay out of the public eye, their love for the town is hard to miss. Hiaasen often uses the area and his childhood experiences as inspiration for his books. Estefan rebuilt a beachfront resort to reflect her appreciation for Vero's natural beauty. And Jake Owen hosts his annual charity event here to raise money for local youth organizations and charities.", "Don't visit during the cooler months When Vero's cooler weather arrives, so, too, do its snowbirds. The influx of retirees and part-time residents from the northern states causes prices at area hotels to rise. If you can stand the heat and humidity, visit during the quieter, more budget-friendly summer season instead.", "Don't stay by the beach The town's top hotels can be found on North Hutchinson Island by the beach. Avoid overpaying for accommodations by bedding down on the mainland. You'll find several no-frills options with lower room rates situated about 10 miles west of the barrier island next to Interstate 95.", "Do your research for flights Orlando International Airport (MCO), which sits about 100 miles northwest of Vero, may offer the most flights of all of the area's airports due to its size, but this doesn't mean it's always the cheapest option. Depending on where you're traveling from, it may make more financial sense to fly into Palm Beach International Airport (PBI) or Orlando Melbourne International Airport (MLB), two smaller airports located less than 40 miles away from Vero.", "Do pack picnic lunches You may be tempted to grab a sandwich or salad from one of Ocean Drive's beachside eateries, but this convenience comes at a cost. To save some coin, opt for an affordable (but equally tasty) sub from Publix. Two Publix locations are available within 3 miles of the two bridges that connect the barrier island to the mainland.", "Venture a few miles south of the Ocean Drive area on the barrier island to sunbathe, look for wildlife, swim, kayak and more at Round Island Oceanside Park and Round Island Riverside Park."]}
