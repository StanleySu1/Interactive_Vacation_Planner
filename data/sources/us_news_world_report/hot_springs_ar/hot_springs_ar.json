{"name": "Hot Springs, AR", "description": ["Nestled in Arkansas' Ouachita Mountains about 55 miles southwest of Little Rock, Hot Springs serves as a beacon for outdoor enthusiasts and relaxation seekers from around the country. A network of springs inspires the town's name and attracts a majority of its visitors. In fact, these thermal waters have beckoned travelers for thousands of years, starting with Native Americans. Today, visitors flock to the town's historic Bathhouse Row. Hot Springs' naturally heated springs are protected as part of Hot Springs National Park, but the city and the park are intertwined in such a way that visitors may feel like they're staying in the park itself.", "While Arkansas may not immediately come to mind when travelers think about dining, entertainment and shopping, the modest town of Hot Springs also checks all those attractions off the list with its casino, water park and a wide variety of shops, art galleries and eateries. Meanwhile, the city's rich history and unique buildings delight amateur (and professional) historians and architects. Still, the main reasons to visit are to bathe in the town's namesake hot springs and revel in the surrounding wilderness.", "The best time to visit Hot Springs is August to October and February to April. Many of the attractions in and around Hot Springs revolve around the water, so travelers will be most comfortable visiting during the warmer months, when drying off won't immediately induce shivering. Still, given that Arkansas is located in the balmy south, there are several acceptable months to plan a trip. Subsequently, the shoulder seasons are the best time to visit, as travelers can save money and bask in the sun.", "Prepare for rain Most visitors experience some rainfall during their visit to Hot Springs, so remember to pack a waterproof coat and check the forecast before heading out on the trail.", "Rent a boat Numerous eateries and attractions are accessible through the waterways surrounding Hot Springs, so renting a boat offers an entertaining and efficient way to explore the area.", "Pack a swimsuit To make the most of your Hot Springs visit, you\u2019ll want to pack a swimsuit to experience the historic bathhouses that line Central Avenue, aka Bathhouse Row.", "Explore outside Hot Springs' various outdoor attractions, including the Grand Promenade and Lake Ouachita State Park, are all either cheap or free, making them budget-friendly options for visitors.", "Camp Instead of staying at one of the city's many hotels, travelers hoping to save a dime can opt to sleep in either Hot Springs National Park (at Gulpha Gorge Campground) or Lake Catherine State Park. Consider consulting Hipcamp for private campgrounds in the area.", "The culinary scene in Hot Springs is mostly concentrated downtown, with the majority of restaurants offering American and Italian fare (think: barbecue, burgers and pizza). Most eateries are casual, although travelers seeking a more upscale experience won't have trouble finding fine dining establishments. There are also a few notable Asian and Mexican food joints in town, if you\u2019ve had your fill of burgers and fries. ", "Don't miss sampling a fried pie \u2013 Arkansas is famous for these tasty pastries, and you\u2019ll find some of the best in Hot Springs (Morrison\u2019s Fried Pies is worth the short drive from downtown, according to locals). McClard's Bar-B-Q Restaurant, a Hot Springs mainstay that's been around since 1928, is also worth the quick drive from downtown. ", "Finally, craft beverages are an integral part of the city's food scene, so be sure to pair your meal with a locally made brew. Superior Bathhouse Brewery is a favorite as it\u2019s the only brewery located in a national park and the only brewery in the world that brews its beer with thermal spring water.", "The best way to get around Hot Springs is by car. The small Memorial Field Airport (HOT) sits adjacent to Hot Springs, but most out-of-state travelers opt to land at Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport (LIT) in Little Rock. From the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport, visitors can rent a car from one of the many on-site rental companies and drive 55 miles southwest across Arkansas from Little Rock to Hot Springs. You'll need the car when exploring Hot Springs as public transit throughout the town, and Arkansas as a whole, is relatively scarce. That said, downtown (especially Bathhouse Row) is walkable.", "Nestled in Arkansas' Ouachita Mountains about 55 miles southwest of Little Rock, Hot Springs serves as a beacon for outdoor enthusiasts and relaxation seekers from around the country.
