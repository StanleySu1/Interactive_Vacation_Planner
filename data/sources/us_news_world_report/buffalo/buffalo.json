That belief, paired with roll-up-the-sleeves determination, has transformed the city from a rust-belt has-been to a destination worth discovering.", "But despite all its revitalization and growth, Buffalo is still a bigger city (the second largest in New York) with a small-town feel \u2013 prices won\u2019t break the bank, everything is less than a 20-minute drive away, and it\u2019s nicknamed the \"City of Good Neighbors\" for a reason: the people here are warm and welcoming, always ready to converse with strangers over a pint, dig your car out of a snowbank and share insider tips on the best that Buffalo has to offer.", "The best time to visit Buffalo is between June and September. Although summertime is the most crowded and the city's high season, the weather can't be beat: Average highs are in the upper 70s and lower 80s.

In Buffalo, portions of ethnic cuisine tend to be huge and affordable.", "Amidst the varied menus are certain foods Buffalo is most famous for. Buffalo wings, served with blue cheese and never ranch, are an icon; every neighborhood will swear their corner pub serves the best, but Anchor Bar, Duff\u2019s and Bar-Bill Tavern usually top the list.
