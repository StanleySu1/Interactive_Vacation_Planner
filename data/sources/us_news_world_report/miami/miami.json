", "But there's another side of this town that is heavily influenced by Latin culture. A large portion of the city's population is made up of people from Cuba, Puerto Rico and Haiti.

And as with most big cities, bike-share and scooter programs are another option for exploring short distances.", "When flying into south Florida (which includes West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Greater Miami), you have several options. The Miami airport is the largest and right next to downtown, but some tourists prefer flying into the less-hectic Fort Lauderdale International Airport (FLL), renting a car and then driving the 25 miles to the city. There are also several regional airports scattered throughout south Florida."]}
