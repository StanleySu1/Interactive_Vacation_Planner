{"name": "Napa Valley", "description": ["After a visit to Napa Valley in 1880, writer Robert Louis Stevenson declared, \"Wine is bottled poetry.\" You'll see this quote as you pass one of two landmark signs on U.S. Highway 29. Unfortunately, Stevenson was referring to French wine \u2013 saying this was what Napa vintners should aspire to. But as the film \"Bottle Shock\" documents, California wineries have since risen to the level of their European predecessors. Now, both connoisseurs and amateurs alike savor the respected vintages from Napa. Whatever your level of expertise, a guided tour can assist in your quest to visit the top Napa Valley wineries.", "With its increase in popularity and acclaim within the wine industry, Napa Valley has also become a vacation hot spot and one of the top things to do in California. The tiered hillsides, wine caverns and illustrious estates make for stellar scenery, and top-class hotels are taking note. Scattered between Napa's vineyards, its sumptuous resorts cater to every indulgence \u2013 golfing, spa services, gourmet dining, you name it. A trip to California wine country is made unforgettable by not only Napa's life-changing cabernet, but also its intoxicating natural setting. And if you can afford it, you'll be back for more.", "The best time to visit Napa is August through October or March through early May. Napa's peak tourist season corresponds with the region's harvest season (August through October), and the numbers of summer travelers start to increase sharply in May. During this busy time, expect crowds and high prices for just about everything, especially accommodations. If you catch the tail end of the harvest season, you'll enjoy the area's beautiful autumn weather, complete with changing leaves and the chance of lower hotel rates. March through May, when the summer rush has yet to arrive, is another prime time to visit. If you're looking to save a few bucks and don't mind chillier weather, a trip between December and February will likely be less crowded and more affordable (just remember to pack an umbrella). Plus, there are a number of food events that take place during this time, including Napa Valley Restaurant Week in January.", "Regardless of when you plan your Napa vacation, you'll find plenty to do, as most wineries don't experience seasonal closures, and festivals are held year-round. Temperatures vary greatly across the valley between morning and evening (sometimes by as much as 30 degrees), so you'll want to pack a light jacket no matter what time of year you visit.", "You'll need a vehicle Public transportation in Napa is limited, which means you'll likely need a car \u2013 and certainly need a designated driver to safely visit multiple wineries on the same day. Enrolling in a Napa Valley tour that includes shuttle service to several vineyards is also good option, but usually means crowds. There is no easy answer, but whatever you choose, be safe and abide by the law.", "Seasons greetings While summer is the most popular time to visit, winter might be the best for you \u2013 and your pocketbook. Plus, you'll encounter the festive holiday decorations and benefit from discounted room rates that summertime Napa visitors don't get to enjoy.", "Make a reservation Many wineries will not allow travelers to visit without a reservation. Check wineries before your trip and make reservations ASAP; some of the more popular wineries and tasting rooms fill up weeks in advance. That said, there are more than 90 urban tasting rooms in downtowns across Napa Valley with no reservation required.", "Make tailored plans for kids Although the region practically runs on wine, Napa Valley also has plenty of kid-friendly activities \u2013 including some stellar wineries that allow kids (check out Castello di Amorosa). Bring something to keep your kids occupied if you're doing a sit-down tasting. Don't miss a Napa kid favorite: hands-on experiences with wildlife at Connolly Ranch.", "If you love food, then you'll love Napa. And thanks to its array of award-winning restaurants, you'll have no trouble finding delectable international cuisine to enjoy alongside your incredible wine. After all, properly pairing food and wine is extremely important in California wine country. But expect to spend big bucks when it comes to dinnertime in Napa, as the majority of restaurants offer fine dining. You'll have your pick of high-end menus (and Michelin star recipients) but there are also a handful of delicious yet more casual that won't break the bank. French, Italian and farm-to-table options abound. Paying a visit to the Oxbow Public Market is also a budget-friendly way to enjoy a variety of local foods in a casual setting (and pick up some souvenirs while you're at it). Joining a food tour is another way to sample some of the area's top-notch cuisine at a fraction of the price.", "If you're willing to venture directly outside of Napa city proper to some of the surrounding towns and restaurants, you'll find equally yummy dishes, sometimes even at lower prices. While Yountville is known for its high-end, Michelin-starred fare, you can also hit up St. Helena for a wide range of locally sourced dishes in environments from elevated to casual. A word of advice: Make your reservations well in advance for fine dining experiences.", "The best way to get around Napa Valley is by car. Many of Napa's wineries and vineyards are spread out among the 30-mile-long, 5-mile-wide valley, making getting to and from the area's more remote wine establishments a challenge without your own set of wheels. However, if you plan on sticking around Napa and its downtown area, getting around Napa without a car is possible. The Vine Transit, the valley's bus transportation, runs routes throughout central Napa as well as a bus service that takes you all the way to Vallejo, where you can catch the ferry to San Francisco.", "San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and Oakland International Airport (OAK) are the closest international airports to Napa Valley, both sitting about 60 miles south. Sonoma County Airport (STS) is the nearest regional airport, sitting about 30 miles northwest of Napa. You can find rental cars at the airports or in central Napa, specifically along the Napa-Vallejo Highway. If you plan to drive from vineyard to vineyard, you should have a designated driver ready. Taxis, ride-hailing services, such as Lyft and Uber, and private chauffeurs are available in the Napa region, just bear in mind that utilizing these services for your wine adventures will cost you. Consider joining one of the top Napa Valley tours, such as the popular Napa Valley Wine Train, to avoid the high cost."]}
