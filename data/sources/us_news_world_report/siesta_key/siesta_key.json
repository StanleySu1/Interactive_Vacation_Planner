{"name": "Siesta Key", "description": ["Located on the Gulf Coast of Florida, just south of Sarasota and less than 70 miles south of Tampa, Siesta Key is a respite from the hurried world. This beach town is the perfect place to slow down and relax, to take your time to unwind and soak up the Florida sunshine. Best known for its dazzling white, powder soft sand beaches that are consistently ranked among the best in the U.S., and indeed the world, Siesta Key is a must-visit for beachgoers. Even in the heat of the summer, the sand stays cool because of its composition: 99% pure quartz. Aside from the long stretch of wide beaches, Siesta Key enjoys myriad dining options and plenty of outdoor activities, and is within close proximity to all of the arts and culture for which nearby Sarasota is known.", "The best time to visit Siesta Key is April to May and September to October, when temperatures are lower and crowds are fewer than peak season, which is December through March. The months from June to August are also busy because school is out for the summer; the summer months are hot and humid, too.", "Let someone else drive traffic can be challenging on Siesta Key during the busier times of year. Avoid the headache by hopping on the free Siesta Island open-air trolley that runs daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.", "Be an early bird Arrive early (before 9 a.m.) at the Siesta Key Beach Pavilion and Turtle Beach for free parking. If the spots are filled, there are free and metered parking lots nearby.", "Mind the turtles Sea turtle nesting season runs May 1 through October 31, so you may spot cordoned off areas on the beach indicating nests during this timeframe. Do not disturb! Learn more about the turtles at Mote Marine Laboratory's website.", "Check websites If you enjoy going out to eat, check the restaurant's website before heading out the door to see if they have happy hour specials. The team at the Siesta Key Chamber of Commerce can help steer you in the right direction.", "Check the calendar For lower hotel rates, not to mention fewer crowds, consider visiting Siesta Key outside of high season, which runs from December through March."]}
