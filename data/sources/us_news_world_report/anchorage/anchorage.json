{"description": ["Alaska's most populous city sits on land occupied for centuries by the Dena'ina Athabascan people, whose access to the temperate climate and abundance of subsistence resources aligned perfectly with the land. Anchorage proper was founded upon the muddy banks of Ship Creek in 1914 with the arrival of the Alaska Railroad. An unimpressive collection of tents then, the city grew into a neat grid of homes and businesses that has since blossomed into the state's financial, commercial and cultural hub, with 40% of the state's population residing in the \"Anchorage Bowl,\" with Cook Inlet to the west and the Chugach Mountains to the east. More than 100 languages are spoken at Anchorage schools, and 20 unique Alaska Native groups live within the municipality.", "From the ground, Anchorage looks like any other urban sprawl, and not much like the tourist brochures. It isn't until you step off the ordinary, everyday sidewalks and into a wealth of activities that one realizes the \"real\" Alaska was right here, all along. The convenience of urban resources combines with an allure of rural wilderness, meeting quite comfortably in parks, on trails and among its fabulous eateries. Anchorage is the logical home base for visitors to Alaska, boasting a plethora of attractions, including museums, cultural centers, recreational opportunities and access to remote sections of the state thanks to the Lake Hood Seaplane Base, the busiest in the world. Visit during the summer to experience the \"City of Lights and Flowers\" (home to about 80,000 flowers throughout 460 flower beds) in full bloom, or between September and April to be dazzled by the sparkling northern lights (several of the best Alaska tours can help you spot them).", "The best time to visit Anchorage is June through August. Summer is the most popular time to visit Anchorage, with most visitors arriving between May and September. Alaska's famous \"midnight sun\" brings long, lingering daylight and short nights (solstice is celebrated on June 21 each year), and a full array of blooming gardens and flower beds almost everywhere you look. But don't expect swimsuit weather; Anchorage's position on the map means a temperate climate, with temperatures between June and August hovering in the mid-60s. Autumn brings cooler temperatures and fewer crowds along with stunning foliage in bright yellows and reds. Winter in Anchorage means cold temperatures, but lots of sunshine and snow-themed sports, including dog mushing, skiing and ice skating. You'll also have a better chance to see the aurora borealis, or northern lights. The spring months are a time of change, with snow melting by late April, and a wealth of early-season travel deals on hand for visitors.", "Take time to see the city The municipality of Anchorage covers a huge area of 1,947 square miles, stretching south to the community of Girdwood, and north to the village of Eklutna. Plan to spend at least three days in Alaska's largest city, and get to know its urban and rural attractions.", "Make reservations Know that Alaska welcomes more than 2 million visitors each year, and many of them stop in Anchorage. Hotels, rental cars, flights and restaurants are packed, so securing reservations at least six months in advance of your arrival is a must.", "Become educated about wildlife Anchorage is home to black and brown bears, moose, bald eagles and many other animals. Residents learn from an early age how to avoid conflicts and make smart decisions regarding wildlife viewing or photo-ops. Before arriving in Anchorage, take time to review the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's bear and moose safety resources.", "Book early Alaska's high season between May and October means paying a premium for lodging and most attractions, so making reservations for both can mean the difference between an affordable visit and an exorbitant one.", "Buy the Alaska TourSaver The Alaska TourSaver is a trusted coupon book with two-for-one deals on everything from flightseeing to RV rentals. Currently priced at $99, the TourSaver can save visitors hundreds of dollars.", "Consider a fall, spring or winter visit Most people want to arrive in Alaska during the summer months, thinking they'll miss out on things like bear-viewing, fishing or cruising otherwise. But Alaska is truly a four-season destination, with spring and fall offering the sweetest deals on many of the activities for which the state is famous. Try booking a trip in May or September for bear-viewing and fishing; or February and March to spot the famous aurora borealis.", "The best way to get around Anchorage is by car. Anchorage is a sprawling municipality stretching almost 70 miles between the communities of Girdwood to the south and Eklutna village to the north. While there is plenty to see and do in the downtown Anchorage area by foot or bike, having access to a vehicle expands access to activities. Rental car agencies are plentiful in Anchorage, either at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) or satellite locations across the city. In general, rates will be higher at the airport. Most Anchorage hotels will offer a shuttle service to and from the airport, but check ahead of time to ensure transportation will be available during your visit."]}
