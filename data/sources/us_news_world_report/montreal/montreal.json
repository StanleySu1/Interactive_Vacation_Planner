{"name": "Montreal", "description": ["Two words of friendly greeting capture the essence of Montr\u00e9al: \"Bonjour, hi.\" When you hear them, you\u2019ll know the person you\u2019re meeting is bilingual, like most folks here. The people of Montr\u00e9al are both fiercely proud of the city\u2019s French heritage, culture and language, and welcoming to non-French-speaking visitors. The local architecture reflects a mix of the Old and New Worlds. Its unique skyline mingles 19th-century Beaux-Arts structures with 21st-century contemporary gems. Historic stone houses are now home to funky fusion restaurants. And languages from around the world can be heard on the street, along with the \u201crolled r\u201d of native French speakers. Rainbow banners fly alongside Canada\u2019s red and white maple leaf flag, while traditional French and Italian pastries are sold next door to distinctly sweet Montr\u00e9al-style bagels.

Even so, you may find it handy to bring a phrasebook or download the Google Translate smartphone app for menu items or signage on your trip.", "Prepare for cold weather This city is no stranger to winter weather. Between December and March, temperatures range from an average low of 10 degrees Fahrenheit to a high, if you can call it that, of 24 degrees. The real issue is the high humidity and the biting wind that blows off the St. Lawrence River, which makes it feel much colder. Pack plenty of warm clothes and sturdy winter boots during winter months.", "Leave the car behind Although parking is cheap, gas prices are not. For the most part, the expansive public transportation system will get you where you need to go.", "Travel during the shoulder seasons Early spring and late fall are quieter times for Montr\u00e9al, meaning hotels and restaurants are not as crowded, spring flowers are blooming or fall colors are at their best.", "Rely on your own two feet Montr\u00e9al is a very walkable city, especially if you explore it by neighborhood.
