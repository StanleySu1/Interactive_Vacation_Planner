{"name": "Niagara Falls", "description": ["It's not hard to understand why many consider Niagara Falls a top natural wonder of the world. Or why it has been the location of some incredible (and now illegal) daredevil antics over the years. The second you see the mammoth Niagara River rumbling toward a 188-foot waterfall at about 20 to 30 (and up to 68) mph, your mouth will drop. The speed at which the river falls creates a misty fog full of rainbows and an unmistakable roar heard from miles away. From the top, crowds flock to the railings to feel the mist on their faces. As you follow the water's path downward, boats, platforms and observation decks support colorful poncho-clad visitors.", "Over the years, Niagara has gone from classic honeymoon spot to cheesy honeymoon spot and, now, it's an odd mix of the two. In addition to the stunning waterfalls, there is a large concentration of quickie wedding chapels and hotels backlit in blaring neon. But strolling through the vineyards of nearby wineries is truly romantic, as is enjoying the lush landscape at the Niagara Parks Botanical Gardens. So, hop in the two-seater with your special someone or pack your family in the minivan and take a spectacular trip to the majestic Niagara Falls.", "The best time to visit Niagara Falls is June to August. Summer is peak season, and with good reason: Average highs rest in the low 80s. Mists and breezes from the waterfalls can make the area feel cooler. You'll spend more money and face more crowds, but visiting in summer will allow you to take full advantage of the weather and attractions. Plus, the free Discover Niagara Shuttle is in full operation during the summer season, making it easy to get from one attraction to another. Spring and fall welcome fewer tourists thanks to the plummeting temps, but there are a few advantages to each season. Fall constitutes harvest season at local wineries, while spring's warming temperatures usher in colorful blooms at the botanical gardens. Winter sees below-freezing temperatures, causing many attractions, such as the Maid of the Mist boat tours, to shut down. However, the frigid climate does drive down hotel rates.", "Pick a side You can view the falls from either the Ontario or the New York side. Most visitors prefer the Canadian side, which also has a nicer selection of restaurants and hotels.", "Exchange currency Canada's official currency is the Canadian dollar, but U.S. dollars, as well as major credit cards, will be accepted on either side. On the other hand, exchanging money before crossing into Canada and taking advantage of the exchange rate isn't a bad idea, depending on the fluctuating currencies.", "Consider an activities pass The Wonder Pass covers admission to several top attractions, including the Journey Behind the Falls, the Butterfly Conservatory and Niagara Parks Power Station.", "As is the case with large tourist attractions, you\u2019ll find plenty of chain restaurants and street food vendors clustered around the falls. But if you\u2019re on the hunt for a unique meal that shows off the region\u2019s flavors (and wine), you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "Along with fish and chips, you'll notice many of the Canadian restaurants borrow traditions from the U.K., with servings of English classics and high tea. While wine regions on both sides of the border feature smaller, family-run wineries and larger winemakers that ship worldwide, most visitors prefer the Canadian wines. They\u2019re showcased in pairings at winery restaurants and on many local farm-to-table menus throughout Niagara Falls.", "On the American side, a handful of family-owned restaurants in the Little Italy section of Niagara Falls have welcomed hungry visitors for generations, offering generous portions of homemade pasta and regional-style pizza. With the city\u2019s proximity to Buffalo, chicken wings served with fiery Buffalo sauce and a side of blue cheese are the real deal here. For a foodie\u2019s selection of upscale dining, breweries and local cafes, head to historic downtown Lewiston\u2019s quaint main street.", "Although it welcomes a large number of tourists every year, Niagara Falls is still a relatively small and safe town. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't use common sense. Keep a close eye on your personal items, especially in more crowded areas. You'll also want to exercise some caution around the falls themselves. They produce a large amount of mist, which can impose a slippery film on the walkways surrounding the falls. Wear shoes with traction, and hold on to the rails to avoid slipping.", "The best way to get around Niagara Falls is on foot. Walking around the area is relatively easy (when there is no snow). Even getting across the United States to Canada border is only a 20-minute walk across the Rainbow Bridge. What's more, attractions are generally close together and within walking distance of one another. If your feet are feeling a bit weary, you can hop on the American side\u2019s efficient (and free) Discover Niagara Shuttle. Having a car can make your trip more stressful, since roads are prone to congestion and parking is very expensive.", "If you're not driving in from a nearby city, you'll likely fly into Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF), which sits about 30 miles southeast of the falls. Niagara Falls International Airport (IAG) is located much closer to the falls (less than 10 miles), but it only operates flights from Allegiant departing or arriving from a handful of Florida cities. There are shuttles from both airports to both sides of the falls, plus rental cars, taxis and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft can be utilized to and from the airports.", "At Niagara Falls, you can cross from the U.S. into Canada (and vice versa) over the Rainbow Bridge, though all persons must have a passport, a New York State enhanced license or a NEXUS pass. No matter how you cross (on foot, by bike or by car), you'll also be expected to pay a small toll. For children, a birth certificate will suffice. Visit the Canada Border Services Agency website for the latest information on foreign exit and entry requirements.", "On the Journey Behind the Falls, you'll be able to stand directly behind the roaring sheet of water and get a literal behind-the-scenes peek at this magnificent natural attraction."]}
