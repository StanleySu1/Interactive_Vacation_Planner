{"name": "West Palm Beach", "description": ["Home to America's rich and famous for more than a century, West Palm Beach provides the most luxurious version of the relaxing Floridian lifestyle \u2013 or so people think. It's actually Palm Beach, the barrier island across the Intracoastal Waterway, where these moguls and celebrities choose to establish their opulent winter homes. Its younger sister, West Palm Beach, was originally an offshoot designed to support the construction and growth of Palm Beach.", "But the West Palm Beach of today is a vacation spot in its own right, offering travelers an array of away-from-the-shore attractions and hotel options for all budgets. While the rest of the country battles snowstorms, residents of West Palm Beach soak up Florida's year-round sunshine. And despite the area's tradition of catering to glamorous, designer-clad clientele, Palm Beach's shores and West Palm's historical neighborhoods appeal to many types. In fact, the famous residents is part of the city's allure.", "The best time to visit West Palm Beach is during its shoulder seasons at the end of spring (April to May) and the beginning of fall (September to October) to avoid the hottest temperatures and highest prices. You'll be greeted by temperatures that hover in the 70s while avoiding peak crowds and inflated airfare and hotel rates. Families often visit while school is out during the summer; however this is also Florida's hurricane season (specifically, June 1 to November 30). In winter, part-time residents (better known as \"snowbirds\") flock to the area to escape the North's cooler temperatures. Though prices and visitors are at their peak, there's a reason so many people flock to the area during the winter: the warm sunshine stands in stark contrast to the cold, drab weather of many other places and there's a plethora of social events to attend.", "This is not a beach town Though West Palm's name implies a prime position along the ocean, you won't actually find a beach here. For those looking to get their toes in the sand, try heading east to Palm Beach, north to Juno Beach or south to Lake Worth.", "Expect to drive While the city does offer a bus system called Palm Tran and a free mobility service called RideWPB to navigate the downtown area, the most convenient way to explore the city and its surroundings is to rent a car.", "Get active outdoors West Palm Beach offers some of the best outdoor activities in Florida \u2013 think biking and kayaking in Okeeheelee Park, hiking and guided paddling in Grassy Waters Preserve and golfing at the newly renovated The Park West Palm. There's also plenty of top-notch scuba diving, polo and fishing in West Palm's neighboring cities.", "Avoid Florida's peak season Like other Florida cities, West Palm's crowds and prices swell substantially during the winter. To bypass the inundation of tourists, part-time Northern residents and peak season hotel and airfare rates, try visiting in Florida's shoulder seasons (in spring after Easter and in autumn before Thanksgiving).", "Use the downtown mobility service While a car is a must for getting to neighboring cities and attractions like Lion Country Safari and McCarthy's Wildlife Sanctuary, RideWPB offers free on-demand transportation in wrapped vans, carts and Teslas. A convenient dedicated route also connects downtown West Palm Beach, City Hall, the Mandel Public Library, the Brightline and Tri-Rail train stations and The Square.", "Take advantage of free activities With such a heavy emphasis on getting outdoors, visitors can expect to find tons of free activities throughout Palm Beach County like taking walks through parks and protected areas. At night, hit up one of the area beaches during the beginning of turtle nesting season (March to October) to try catching a glimpse of a turtle laying eggs.", "West Palm Beach's restaurant options give its Intracoastal Waterway neighbor a legitimate run for its money \u2013 especially since you'll end the meal here with more money in your pocket. With such close proximity to the water, West Palm cuisine relies heavily on fresh seafood like grouper and shrimp, two of the area's most popular items. For a true taste of West Palm's seafood scene, try grabbing a bite at a local favorite like Tin Fish on Clematis Street or Bimini Twist in the Golden Lakes neighborhood.", "In addition to the area's variety of seafood joints, ethnic restaurants are a crowd favorite. Italian, Mexican and Greek are especially popular here. For authentic Greek fare, try Agora Mediterranean Kitchen, which serves up Greek and Mediterranean classics like dolma (stuffed grape leaves), hummus (a chickpea dip served with pita) and baklava (a sweet layered pastry with nuts). When craving Mexican, locals flock to Rocco's Tacos and Tequila Bar on Clematis Street. And for a taste of Italy, try CityPlace's Il Bellagio, where you can savor Italian specialties like pasta e fagioli (a Tuscan white bean and pasta soup) and linguine vongole (linguine with clams in a white wine or tomato sauce). You'll also find top-notch Cuban throughout the region thanks to the state's proximity to Cuba.", "The best way to get around West Palm Beach is by car if you want to explore beyond downtown. Whether you rent one at Palm Beach International Airport (PBI), use your own or rely on ride-share services, a car will help you make the most of your visit. But if you're keeping to downtown and its attractions, public transportation is the way to get around.", "If you're visiting other parts of Florida, consider booking travel on Tri-Rail (a commuter rail line linking West Palm Beach to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and most of the cities in between) or Brightline (a high-speed train linking West Palm Beach to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Aventura, Boca Raton, and the Orlando International Airport).", "Situated just west of Palm Beach along the Intracoastal Waterway, West Palm Beach is known for its superb climate, thriving arts and culture scene and charming historic neighborhoods."]}
