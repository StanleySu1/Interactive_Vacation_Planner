{"name": "San Miguel de Allende", "description": ["Vibrantly colored buildings line the cobblestone streets of San Miguel de Allende, a romantic city with 16th-century origins, nestled among Mexico's central highlands. Through the past 50 years, this quaint city has evolved into a respite for expats and a popular destination for tourists looking to delve into the music, food and arts scene of off-the-beaten-path Mexico. It's easy to swoon over the 500-year-old colonial city's narrow walkways, baroque architecture and artisan shops selling crafts, jewelry and handmade accessories. Breaks from shopping can be spent exploring the city's elaborate, shimmering pink church, the Parroquia de San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel taking classes at the well-recognized Instituto Allende Allende art school, or tucking into some of the country's best cuisine.", "San Miguel's location \u2014 about 170 miles northwest of Mexico City in Guanajuato state \u2014 plays a key role in its dynamic history. Once full of wealth from nearby silver mines, San Miguel was left dilapidated after multiple wars (the early 20th century's Mexican Revolution among them). In 1937, Chicago native Stirling Dickinson stumbled upon the small town, established an artist's colony and quickly got San Miguel's renaissance off the ground. Today, evidence of that compelling re-emergence can be seen tucked into every lively corner of the diverse, arts-driven destination.", "The best time to visit San Miguel de Allende is November through April; there's minimal rainfall and high temperatures hover around the mid-70s.
