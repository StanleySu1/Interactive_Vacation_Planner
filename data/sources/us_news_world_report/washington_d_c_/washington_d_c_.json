{"name": "Washington, D.C.", "description": ["With its marbled monuments and high-profile politicos, Washington, D.C., has long been saddled with a reputation as a stuffy government-driven town. A \"city of southern efficiency and northern charm,\" as John F. Kennedy once described it, Washington is often seen by outsiders as slow and inefficient. But these days, our nation's capital is awash with a new energy, transforming itself into an exciting, faster-paced East Coast vacation destination. Although the government is still the sun around which this city orbits, the District also offers a host of renowned museums and interesting neighborhoods. And with an explosion of restaurants, cafes, boutiques and clubs, D.C. has become a thriving cultural hub. ", "You can choose a traditional D.C. adventure, filled with tours of classic attractions like the White House and the Washington Monument, the U.S. Capitol and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. And there's no better way to experience iconic D.C. than with a stroll around the Tidal Basin. (Plan to visit in late March or early April \u2013 just in time for the National Cherry Blossom Festival \u2013 and you'll be rewarded with a canopy of beautiful pink blooms.) But if you've already seen the national landmarks, get a feel for the city's more youthful ambiance, highlighted by its urban neighborhoods, marquee art galleries and vibrant farmers markets. While you'll only need a few days to see the city as you know it from your history book, it could take months to experience the Washington that today's locals know and love. ", "The best times to visit Washington, D.C., are from September to November and March to May. In the autumn, the sweltering summer is gone, taking with it most of the high season tourists. All that's left are crisp breezes and changing leaves, which, by the way, look great against all those marble monuments. Second to fall is spring, which is also a mini high season thanks to the National Cherry Blossom Festival in late March and early April. Summer in D.C. is hot and sticky, making less than ideal conditions for exploring the great outdoors. That said, many museums blast air conditioning, so if you can stand the heat, you'll find plenty of free attractions to keep you entertained. Winter is definitely low season. Although the chance to find lower hotel rates is high and the weather is mild compared to other destinations along the East Coast, the city is prone to freezing cold temperatures and snowstorms. For this reason, travel insurance is recommended for anyone planning a winter visit to D.C.", "Make restaurant reservations in advance Popular dining establishments tend to fill up quickly, so ensure your place by making a dinner reservation on OpenTable weeks ahead of time.", "Walk or take public transit \u2013 don't drive Metro trains and buses can take you anywhere you want to go without the hassle of fighting your way through D.C.'s congested streets.", "Stroll the markets D.C. hosts several weekend markets where you can get a feel for the local art and culinary scene.

The city also beckons to people from all parts of the country and places around the world due to its high-power jobs and universities.", "During your time in the nation's capital \u2013 regardless of whether you're a D.C. transplant or tourist \u2013 there are certain unspoken customs to follow. For example, if you don't want to stick out as a visitor while using the metro, remember that the right side of the escalator is for standing; leaving the left side open for those who want to hurry up or down.", "D.C. also has deep roots in black history and the civil rights movement. Since the Revolutionary War, the city has always had a large black population, as freed slaves from the Upper South would move here to find work. This has since influenced much of Washingtonian culture, as people like Frederick Douglass and Duke Ellington both called D.C. home. Ellington was a major player in shaping the city's music scene, playing jazz in venues along the U Street Corridor. Several attractions, including the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, also pay homage to the city's civil rights ties.", "A variety of music, art, nature, food and cultural festivals take place throughout the year in and around the District.

Most travelers (and residents) use a combination of the Metro trains, the buses and their own two feet to get around. You can even take a Metro train or bus into the city from the closest of the area's three airports: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Arlington, Virginia. Renting a car isn't advised; D.C. is regularly ranked as one of America's worst cities for driving. If you must have your own wheels, you should primarily keep them parked at your hotel. You can also traverse the capital city by taxi, but it'll cost you.", "In addition to Reagan Airport, Washington, D.C., is serviced by Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD), located about 31 miles northwest of the city. Another airport, Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI), sits just south of Baltimore. The best way to get from Baltimore/Washington Airport into the city is to take a MARC Train from Union Station. For travel between Reagan Airport and D.C., plan on taking the Metro.
