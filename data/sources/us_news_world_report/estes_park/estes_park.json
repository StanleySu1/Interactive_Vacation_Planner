{"name": "Estes Park", "description": ["Located about 70 miles northwest of Denver and about 75 miles from the Denver International Airport, Estes Park, Colorado, sits at the base of Rocky Mountain National Park. Estes Park provides a great jumping-off point for adventurers who want to stay close to Colorado's outdoor attractions. The area was named Estes Park in 1864 by the owner and editor of the Rocky Mountain News, who decided on the name in honor of the successful gold miner Joel Estes, who lived there from 1860 to 1866. The famous Stanley Hotel opened in Estes Park in 1909. The hotel's construction transformed Estes Park into a luxury retreat town that would welcome Pope St. John Paul II, Emperor Akihito of Japan and President George W. Bush. In 1982, a burst dam in Rocky Mountain National Park caused Estes Park to flood, so the town's current appearance differs a bit from historical photos.", "Nowadays, Estes Park welcomes travelers from all walks of life who want to experience the American Rockies' wilderness while enjoying the comforts of a cozy town. Warm weather provides the ideal setting for hiking, biking, fly-fishing, horseback riding the aerial tram and more. Meanwhile, snow brings cold-weather activities like snowshoeing, backcountry skiing and ice climbing. Whether travelers visit this Colorado town in search of adrenaline-pumping adventure sports or to unwind and breathe the mountain air, they don't leave disappointed after experiencing Estes Park.", "The best time to visit Estes Park is from June to September. The four-month period of warm weather allows travelers to comfortably explore the area's offerings. Still, Estes' Parks natural wonders don't go into hibernation outside of this window; instead, winter snow makes roads significantly more difficult to navigate, and cold weather requires visitors to dress much warmer to maintain some degree of comfort. But even with the lower temperatures that typically hover around 40 degrees, winter still attracts adventurous travelers who want to test themselves against the powder snow of the Rockies.
