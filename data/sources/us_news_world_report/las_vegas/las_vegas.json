While you'll find plenty of travel deals throughout the year, the spring and fall shoulder seasons offer the most moderate weather. Sin City welcomes an influx of visitors during the winter months, especially surrounding New Year's Eve, the Super Bowl and Valentine's Day, and the sweltering summers see daytime temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.

As far as safety is concerned, you should take some extra precautions when on the Strip or in a casino. Cash and alcohol run wild, often placing travelers in compromising situations.

When on the Strip, never walk alone in the evenings, be mindful of the busy road, and follow all street signals and applicable laws. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department offers more tips on its website. ", "The best way to get around Las Vegas is by taxi, a ride-hailing option like Uber or Lyft, or by bus. The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) offers bus routes 24 hours a day along the Strip and downtown area, providing easy, affordable transportation. If you're based on the Strip, the Monorail provides fast transportation to many of the casinos along the Strip like the MGM Grand and Harrah's Las Vegas. If you prefer to walk, you won't have an issue finding most of Vegas' top things to do, but you should arm yourself with plenty of sunscreen and water to avoid heat stroke. ", "To get to and from the Harry Reid International Airport (LAS), which sits about 10 minutes east of the Strip, you have a variety of options. You can hop in a taxi, use a ride-hailing service, or for a more affordable ride, use a shuttle bus or the public bus. RTC buses and shuttle bus companies offer service out of terminals one and three. Car rentals are also available at the airport (and throughout Las Vegas), but unless you're looking to take a trip to the Hoover Dam or the Grand Canyon, you should opt for another means of transportation. Traffic along the Strip is hectic and parking is both scarce and expensive. Plus, several of the best Las Vegas tours provide transportation from the Strip to local landmarks like the Hoover Dam or the Grand Canyon if you don't want to drive yourself. Helicopter tours can also be a memorable way to see these natural wonders or enjoy a bird's-eye view of the Strip's glittering night lights. ATV tours are equally unique ways to see the surrounding desert scenery."]}
