{"name": "Daytona Beach", "description": ["Hearing \"23 miles of beaches\" will tempt many vacation-seekers, but the typical Daytona Beach visitor usually has something else in mind. Despite efforts to appeal to families (Orlando, amusement park central, is about an hour's drive south, depending on traffic), Daytona Beach annually attracts millions of visitors in search of speed and spring break. And although many college kids have moved on to trendier locales (Miami Beach, for one), this east Florida city still remains a frequented spot. Its reputation as the \"it\" party place has welcomed a different type of celebratory atmosphere \u2013 the NASCAR empire. Best known for the Daytona International Speedway, Daytona Beach draws travelers who hope to see their favorite race car drivers up close.", "Residents and visitors alike share a passion for all motor vehicles. Daytona Beach Bike Week and Biketoberfest are regular events that bring thousands to the shore in the spring and fall, respectively. In addition, supercross and kart racing take place regularly. People love their cars so much that vehicles are allowed on the beach in select locations. So gather your family or your friends, pile into your car and motor down to the sand. It's sure to be a high-octane vacation.", "The best time to visit Daytona Beach is between March and May. You'll miss the crowded Speedweeks, a series of events and races leading up to February's Daytona 500. Plus, the tourism hangover from busy February may reward you with cheap rates. In March, you will encounter crowds of motorcyclists during Bike Week and find some students partying, especially when spring break is in full swing. What's more, the weather is unbelievably pleasant \u2013 typically in the 70s during the day.", "Motor mouths NASCAR races and motorcycle weeks bring a fun and, at times, grittier crowds. Keep your kids close if you don't want them to learn some colorful language.", "Year-round rush hour The events at Daytona Beach (including college breaks) pack the calendar all year. If you're looking for a low-key stay, find one of the weeks when nothing is scheduled, like the summertime.", "Proximity pricing Depending on the time of year, hotel rates may climb as you get closer to the beach or the speedway. Look between the two for cheaper options whenever you decide to visit.", "Avoid NASCAR Fanatic fans will pay just about anything to get what they want. Don't get lumped into their escalated hotel rates by visiting during a race unless you want to partake in the excitement.", "Advanced ticket sales If you are coming to Daytona Beach for a specific event, buy your tickets well in advance because thousands of others may be in line before you.", "With Daytona Beach welcoming a continuous stream of diverse visitors from around the globe \u2013 from families to spring breakers to auto racing fans \u2013 it's no surprise that this town caters to a variety of taste buds. Set against the backdrop of the Atlantic Ocean and the Halifax River, it should also be no surprise that fresh seafood (think: raw oysters and the catch of the day) is never in short supply.", "When the weather's nice, opt to eat beachfront, on the piers or boardwalk or at a sidewalk cafe. Whichever you choose, you'll find menus filled with fresh seafood and local flavors, from casual to fine dining to satiate every appetite.", "Meanwhile, fans of craft beer and artisan spirits will want to follow the Ale Trail. Nearly 25 microbreweries and taprooms are found along the trail that stretches throughout the county. If hunger strikes, you'll be happy to know some breweries serve food, while others feature food trucks parked nearby.", "The best way to get around Daytona Beach is by car, so bring your most impressive set of wheels to roll around this automobile-obsessed city. Enjoy the fact that unless it's a race day, traffic shouldn't be a problem. And even if there's a race or your visit is around Biketoberfest or Bike Week, police keep traffic moving. What's more, you can drive and park on the beach in designated places (for a small daily fee). Consult the Volusia County website to learn more.", "If you're coming by air, consider flying into Orlando International Airport (MCO), which is about 75 miles south of Daytona Beach. The Orlando airport has myriad commercial and low-fare flights arriving daily, and shared bus transportation easily transports tourists back and forth, though it can be expensive. If you're lucky, you might find a flight into tiny Daytona Beach International Airport (DAB). The Orlando-Sanford International Airport (SFB) is another option, about 45 miles south of Daytona Beach.", "For those visiting between Memorial Day and Labor Day, the Daytona Beach Boardwalk features nightly street performers like jugglers and magicians who perform for free."]}
