{"name": "Tulsa", "description": ["To understand modern-day Tulsa and its allure for culture hounds and history buffs, you'll need to know a bit about its past. In the early 20th century, Tulsa experienced a rapid influx of wealth thanks to the discovery of oil. In fact, the city was once known as the \"oil capital of the world.\" Oil magnates like Waite Phillips and Thomas Gilcrease used their immense fortunes to create some of the city's top cultural institutions, including the Gilcrease Museum and the Philbrook Museum of Art. Along with these popular attractions, visitors will also see the reverberations of this remarkable affluence in the art deco architecture that's still present throughout downtown Tulsa today. However, alongside this age of prosperity, the city also witnessed one of the worst racial terror attacks in U.S. history: the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. Tulsa, and the nation, are still grappling with the aftermath of this horrific event, as seen in the memorials, monuments and museums located within the historic Greenwood district \u2013 the site of the massacre.", "Today, Tulsa is experiencing a renaissance in everything from its dining scene to its cultural institutions. In the last five years, the city welcomed a trendy food hall (Mother Road Market), an innovative museum dedicated to telling the story of the Tulsa Race Massacre (Greenwood Rising), and a waterfront park (Gathering Place) that will eventually sprawl across 100 acres and features the new Tulsa Children's Museum.", "Tulsa loves its sports Many local haunts offer game-day deals and draw big crowds ready to cheer on the home teams, which include the Tulsa Drillers baseball team, the Tulsa Oilers hockey team and the Tulsa Athletic soccer team, as well as the University of Tulsa and Oral Roberts University.", "Visit in the spring or fall Temperatures settle around 60 degrees, plus several annual events, including Tulsa International Mayfest and Oktoberfest, fill up the calendar.", "Family fun If you\u2019re visiting in the fall, try to time your visit to line up with the annual Tulsa State Fair, a family-friendly excursion with dozens of rides, games and authentic carnival food.", "Take public transportation Tulsa is a relatively affordable destination year-round, but taking public transportation is a good way to save even more money, instead of taking taxis or paying for parking.", "Spend your days outside If you\u2019re visiting when the weather is warmer, head outside to explore Tulsa\u2019s free gardens and parks.
