{"name": "Punta Cana", "description": ["The sugary sand of a Punta Cana beach is so soft, so perfectly golden that you might think it was synthetic. And in fact, in this easternmost tip of the Dominican Republic, it's possible. By definition, Punta Cana is a manufactured Caribbean getaway, completely catering to the needs of sun-seeking vacationers who enjoy all-inclusive resorts, but care little about venturing away from their hotel \u2013 even though there are plenty of hidden gems and adventures waiting for them. Boasting approximately 50,000 hotel rooms at affordable rates, Punta Cana beckons to jet-setters, especially the budget-minded kind.", "While this destination is better known for relaxation than adventure, visitors can get their fill of thrills jumping into Scape Park's Hoyo Azul or perfecting their swing at challenging golf courses like Punta Espada or La Cana. Overall, this reasonably priced Caribbean hideout is made for travelers of all ages seeking a relaxing turn from the norm.", "The best time to visit Punta Cana is from December to April when the dry season in Punta Cana is at its peak. Luckily, the weather is warm year-round, with average highs around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. But keep in mind: The Dominican Republic experiences some of the effects of the Atlantic hurricane season, which lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30. Punta Cana is often spared from severe tropical storms, but the rainiest months are September and October. Still, this area of the Dominican Republic stays crowded no matter the season. If you're looking for the best time to visit in terms of the lowest prices and decent weather, May, June, November and December (up until Christmas) are the best months.", "Expect an international crowd With affordable flights and hotel rates, Punta Cana sees many visitors from Europe and South America. As such, you may see more speedos and thong bikinis than you're used to.", "Do visit your doctor Malaria, typhoid, hepatitis A and other diseases are slightly more prevalent in Punta Cana than in the United States. Check out the Center for Disease Control's website for its recommendations and make an appointment with your doctor for the proper prescriptions and vaccinations. The CDC also warns pregnant women and their partners that Zika is a risk in the Dominican Republic, even though there is currently no outbreak in the country (nor anywhere else in the world).", "Do not drink tap water The local water filtration system is not like that of the U.S., so for your stomach's sake, it's best to drink only bottled water. You won't get sick from brushing your teeth with tap water, but you still can use bottled water to be on the safe side.", "Consider the package deal All-inclusive resorts abound in Punta Cana, and most rates cover all meals and drinks (including alcohol) along with water sports activities.", "Consider the offseason From May to June and September to November (usually even until shortly before Christmas), room rates tend to be the cheapest and tourist volume is at its lowest. Beware of hurricane season, which runs from June to November; chances for tropical storms and hurricanes are much lower in June, July and November compared to August, September and October.", "Consider bartering Haggling is a fine art in Punta Cana. Anyone from street vendors to taxi drivers can be reasoned with, so offer 25% to 40% off the original price and stand firm.", "Most travelers stick close to the resorts to catch up on rest and relaxation at the beach, pool or spa. But, for at least one day, you should venture off your resort to get a sense of the Dominican Republic's history and culture, which is highlighted by tasty local coffee, strong rum and fragrant cigars. Your hotel can help steer you in the right direction, but off-road adventures and boat rides are some of the most common ways to explore outside your resort.", "The official language is Spanish; however, tourism is such a large industry here that English-speaking travelers should have no trouble communicating. And though the official currency is the Dominican peso, many of the Punta Cana resorts and excursion vendors accept United States dollars and major credit cards.", "Most vacationers choose the cozy and convenient restaurants on their all-inclusive premises. Still, those who venture out can find affordable dining, especially at the area's many beachside bars and grills. The Dominican Republic's staple is a dish of white rice, red beans, meat and fried plantains called La Bandera Dominicana (because the colors are reminiscent of the Dominican's red, white and blue flag). Most of the resort's buffets and restaurant menus will feature some additional traditional dishes, such as fried plantains and fish in coconut sauce. Expect to see a wide variety of tropical fruits too. As for drinks, be sure to try the strong local coffee and the Presidente beer. \"Mamajuana\" is another popular, celebratory beverage made of tree bark and herbs soaked in rum, red wine and honey; it tastes like a more potent cinnamon Fireball whisky.", "Punta Cana is one of the safest vacation spots in the Caribbean. Tourists should feel comfortable traveling outside of the hotel zone. However, petty theft (especially of cell phones, according to some) does sometimes occur, so you should be careful when carrying valuables with you. Plan to travel in a group if you leave your resort, and women should be aware that men in Punta Cana can be overly flirtatious. Hotel security is good, and there's even a special branch of the police department devoted to tourist safety, known as Politur or Cestur. Police officers are often stationed in the hotels or along the beach. But previous travelers have had other concerns (specifically health issues) when visiting the Dominican Republic: Many say you should avoid drinking Punta Cana's tap water. Always opt for bottled water and drinks with moderate amounts of ice. Usually, ice in Punta Cana can be consumed without any problems as it is always made with purified water, both in resorts and in public restaurants and street food stalls. Zika and Dengue are other health concerns in the Dominican Republic because of the prevalence of mosquitos. Pregnant women and their partners should consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for the most up-to-date information on the Zika virus.", "The best way to get around Punta Cana is by foot within your all-inclusive resort and the beach and by car if you plan to explore. Buses run along the main strip of hotels, but the irregular schedules and uncomfortable vehicles (be prepared to get squeezed into small minivans) make them a poor choice for getting around. Hotel concierges can easily summon taxis, which are usually pretty expensive. Keep in mind that taxi fares in Punta Cana vary widely, depending on where you're staying, ranging from as little as $20 (even for very short rides) to as much as $80 for a 30- to 40-minute ride. Rental cars are also available at the airport, even though most travelers find that traffic is crazy in the Dominican Republic. If you plan to venture beyond your resort, you'll find that some attractions and most excursions offer shuttle service bundled with the entry fee.", "Uber, which was introduced to Punta Cana in 2020, is a great option for traveling around. However, Ubers are not allowed to pick up passengers at the airport or most resort lobbies (exceptions might apply). Therefore, you either have to walk out to the front gate of your resort to get an Uber or rely on the more expensive taxis. For the airport, most travelers find it easiest to pre-book a private airport transfer if it is not included in your holiday package.", "All United States citizens must travel with a valid passport to enter the Dominican Republic. If you plan to stay for more than 30 days, you need to extend the tourist visa online or in person with the Immigration Department of the Dominican Republic (\"Direcci\u00f3n General de Migraci\u00f3n\"). For more information on entry and exit requirements, visit the U.S. Department of State's website."]}
