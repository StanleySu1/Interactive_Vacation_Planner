{"name": "Miami Beach", "description": ["Miami Beach is where a mix of cultures, residents and travelers mingle. A wide variety of people \u2013 including Instagram models, amateur architecture critics, distinguished seniors and sun-seeking families \u2013 enjoy the renowned shores of \"the Beach,\" as locals call it. North Beach is where you'll find the kid-friendliest beaches, the tranquil greenspace of North Shore Oceanside Park, and the most affordable restaurants and hotels. Less than 10 miles away on the mainland are the galleries, museums and theaters of Greater Miami.", "And then there's South Beach. This popular southernmost neighborhood proves that Miami Beach is more like two cities \u2013 a family-friendly vacation when the sun is shining and a super-chic metropolis come nightfall. If want to keep up with the Joneses, you'll have to exercise your credit card at the high-end stores, indulge at the cutting-edge fusion restaurants, dance at the energetic nightclubs and relax poolside at the art deco-style hotels. But the rich and famous aren't the only ones who will enjoy their time here. More laid-back travelers can relax along the sands of Lummus Park, learn a little more about architecture on an art deco tour or even try their hand at fishing off of the South Pointe Pier. Another must-do? Window-shopping and strolling along the Lincoln Road Mall. And you can't leave Miami Beach without bottomless brunch or chowing down on tasty small plates and enjoying cocktails at a rooftop bar.", "The best time to visit Miami Beach is between March and May when the sun shines with temperatures in the high 70s and low 80s during the day. Aside from the gorgeous weather, a spring visit allows you to sidestep the peak winter rates. This part of Florida enjoys a subtropical climate, meaning it's usually warm year-round and a bit rainy. Pack an umbrella if you visit in summer or fall; at the very least, you can expect some afternoon showers that clear up quickly. In the worst-case scenario, you could experience torrential downpours since Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November. If you're trying to keep your bank account in check, hotel rates and flight fares tend to decrease in the summer as the temperature and precipitation increase.", "Not all sand is the same Different portions of shoreline cater to different crowds. For instance, Haulover Park is the only \"clothing optional\" beach. Our advice: Get to the sand early to survey the scene. Then keep heading north until you discover your own niche.", "Those lounge chairs aren't free If you approach the regularly spaced-out lounge chairs, don't sit in them. They likely belong to the hotel that sits behind them, and someone will come over and try to charge you.", "It's going to rain, of course And so this would be the time to use that rental car, if you have it. Aside from the many clubs and restaurants, the Beach has a few indoor attractions, including The Bass and the Wolfsonian-FIU museums. You can also head over the causeway to Miami to check out other cultural attractions like the Museum of Contemporary Art or Frost Science Museum.", "Get the early bird special Here, this means that you should arrive at your bar or club of choice before they begin charging a cover or raise it. Check the bar's website earlier that day for the specific time. Also, because of cover charges, bar hopping is a luxury that many cannot afford.", "Enjoy the outdoors Many of the area's outdoor activities are completely free to see. Stroll through the Lincoln Road pedestrian mall, saunter down Ocean Drive or sit and watch cruise ships roll in from the South Pointe Park and Pier.", "Consider Fort Lauderdale If you're looking to save on airfare, consider flying into Fort Lauderdale instead by comparing flight prices to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. This smaller airport can oftentimes be quicker to get in and out of. To get to your Miami Beach hotel, you can rent a car or take a shuttle to traverse the 30 miles to Miami Beach.", "Miami Beach is a city of immigrants, with one of the biggest Cuban populations in the country. A large number of Miamians speak Spanish as their first language and it can be heard everywhere in the city. The Cuban culture has, in turn, also influenced the city's music, architecture and food.", "The city also has a thriving gay community, whose focus is in South Beach, especially between 11th and 12th streets. If you're in town in early March, stick around for the Winter Party, an event for the LGBTQ community that draws thousands of visitors every year. Miami Beach Gay Pride is also a big annual event, held in April.", "The streets of Miami Beach are lined with high-end dining establishments teeming with the smells of Cuban, Caribbean, Peruvian, Asian and American cuisine \u2013 sometimes all at once. What other cities call \"fusion\" has a name of its own in Miami Beach: \"Floribbean.\" Prepare to be impressed with its taste and the relatively cheap prices. The South Beach area does have its share of expensive eateries, but the most affordable options are tucked away on the side streets. When it comes to meals, some signature Miami Beach dishes visitors should try include stone crab, ceviche, empanadas, Cuban pork sandwiches and pastelitos (pastries filled with sweet or savory fillings)", "In South Beach, avoid the restaurants and bars along Ocean Drive and Lincoln Road mall that lure in tourists with overpriced food and oversized margaritas. Instead, head to Sunset Harbor for innovative fare from local chefs or Espa\u00f1ola Way for European-style sidewalk cafes and al fresco dining. The South of Fifth, or SoFi, neighborhood (named for its location south of Fifth Street) has some of the best upscale and trendy restaurants in South Beach, but brace yourself for a big bill at the end of your meal.", "You'll find other top restaurants from acclaimed chefs inside the luxury resorts along Collins Avenue from Mid-Beach to South Beach. If you're staying farther north in North Beach, the cuisine spans most of Latin America, and expansive Kosher dining options abound in Surfside's city center.", "To taste the best of Miami Beach and beyond, consider attending the South Beach Food & Wine Festival. The five-day event, held every February, draws celebrity chefs from around the country (and globe) for a lineup of walkaround tasting events and private dinners.", "Miami Beach is generally a safe city for visitors. However, as with most major tourist destinations, pickpocketing is the biggest concern, particularly during the lively nighttime and along busy Washington Avenue. Walk in groups at night and avoid any unfamiliar territory. If you have a car in town, keep valuables hidden so your vehicle is not made a target for a theft.", "When swimming, stay near a lifeguard station and watch for the flags, a system that follows the same pattern for beaches across the state. Green means the water is calm, while yellow signals some moderate surf conditions like stronger currents. Purple signifies the presence of marine animals like jellyfish. Note that you are forbidden from entering the water when a double-red flag is raised, which may be due to rough water conditions, pollution, dangerous marine life or lightning.", "The best way to get around Miami Beach is on foot. South Beach is especially pedestrian-friendly, and how are you going to people-watch or get a tan if you're in a car? Bikes are another option; they can be rented from a number of vendors or from the bike-sharing system, Citi Bike. Plan to pack or purchase a strong lock as bicycle theft can be a problem. Driving will bring headaches, particularly since parking is limited at peak hours. If your feet begin to tire, there are buses run by Miami-Dade Transit. The free Miami Beach Trolley is ultra-convenient, as it makes stop throughout South Beach and will also take you along Collins Avenue to the Mid-Beach and North Beach neighborhoods. Still, hailing the occasional cab (or Uber or Lyft) rather than waiting at a bus or trolley stop is preferred. You'll probably also use a cab to get from Miami International Airport (MIA), located about 12 miles west, into town. Expect to pay a metered rate between $35 and $55 for trips to Miami Beach. There's also the Miami Beach Airport Express shuttle bus that provides service between the Miami International Airport Metrorail station and Miami Beach (from 41st Street to South Pointe Drive) for $2.25.", "South Pointe Park (situated at the southernmost end of Miami Beach) is a sprawling 17-acre green space that's popular for recreation, picnics and more.
