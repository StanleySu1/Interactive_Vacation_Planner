{"name": "Destin", "description": ["Nicknamed the \"World's Luckiest Fishing Village,\" Destin has grown into one of the most popular vacation spots on the Florida Panhandle. Founded in the 1850s, Destin used to be a sleepy fishing town until a bridge connected the skinny peninsula with Florida's mainland and Eglin Air Force Base opened in the mid-1930s. With a baseline population of 13,000 residents (which inflates to 25,000-plus during the summer), this town retains an intimate, friendly atmosphere. Midwestern and Southern families flock to Destin's beaches each summer for the city's trademark bright white sands, made up of pure Appalachian quartz. This unique sand not only stays cool in the summer heat, but also gives the water its emerald tint as the sunlight bounces off the grains. Golfers traverse seaside bunkers, while kids splash in the water parks. More adventurous visitors snorkel and scuba dive off the coast or charter a boat to try their luck at deep sea fishing. After all, casting a line is an integral part of this peninsular paradise.", "The best time to visit Destin is in April and May when the water is warm, the sun is shining and the temperatures are comfortable (expect highs in the mid-70s and mid-80s). Even though it's Florida, Destin is on the northern edge of the Sunshine State and if you visit any earlier, you risk cooler weather and chilly water. A summer trip will put you among the crowds and the peak prices. Although you might consider late summer and early fall, the temperatures can be sweltering and accompanied by rain. Average highs reach the high 80s in summer, while winter temps average in the 60s. Some travelers do visit in the winter offseason when rates drop, but they may miss out on the area's top activities.", "Keep the top down If you choose to drive, summer beach traffic in this small community can slow your pace. Renting a convertible will let you enjoy the sun even if you're stuck in gridlock.", "Avoid hurricane season Destin is not immune to the threat of hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. Keep an eye on the weather if you're planning to visit during these months.", "Try a fishing charter If you're looking to try your luck with a rod and reel, book a fishing charter; after all, there are nearly 200 fishing charters in Destin. Experienced captains will take you to prime spots and teach you the basics if you're new to fishing.", "Fly here, fly there Three medium-size airports (Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport, Pensacola International Airport and the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport) are within a reasonable driving distance of Destin (the farthest is about 60 miles away). Explore your flight and rental car options at all three airports to secure the best prices for your trip.", "Use two wheels instead of four Avoid the region's trademark traffic by hopping on a bike instead of in your car. A new multi-use, 12-foot-wide path is coming soon, stretching about 4 miles between the Brooks Bridge and Marler Bridge. You'll save on gas and parking fees as well.", "You've likely heard restaurants described as \"farm-to-table,\" but what about \"Gulf-to-table\"? In a city nicknamed the \"World's Luckiest Fishing Village,\" it should come as no surprise that Florida's fresh seafood is the backbone of the city's dining scene. If you're into catching your own dinner, plenty of local restaurants will cook your catch for you and serve it up with all the sides.", "Not a fan of seafood? No worries \u2013 Destin's got you covered, too. You'll find eateries serving up globally inspired dishes, as well as traditional American and southern fare. Beach casual is the vibe at many of the restaurants in Destin, so there's no problem with walking up to a venue in shorts and flip-flops to grab a bite to eat.", "Destin is very safe, but it's still always best to use common sense. Lock your car doors and make sure valuables are secured. Also, in order to avoid health complications, such as sunburn and heatstroke, drink plenty of water and apply sunscreen throughout the day.", "If you're hitting the beach, make sure that you learn about the flag system, which is used on all of Destin's beaches. A green flag means that swimming conditions are safe, a yellow flag represents a medium hazard (like strong undercurrents) and a red flag means that conditions are dangerous. Two red flags show that swimming is prohibited while a purple flag warns swimmers that there are marine pests (such as jellyfish) in the water. Before jumping in, always make sure that a lifeguard is present.", "The best way to get around Destin is by car. Driving enables you to visit any of the 12 beach access points and, despite the traffic, is the preferred mode of transportation. Most vacationers drive to Destin instead of flying into Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport (VPS). The Pensacola International Airport (PNS) \u2013 located about 60 miles west of Destin \u2013 and the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport (ECP) \u2013 around 50 miles east \u2013 also serve the area, but are located more than an hour away. You can rent a car from any of these airports."]}
