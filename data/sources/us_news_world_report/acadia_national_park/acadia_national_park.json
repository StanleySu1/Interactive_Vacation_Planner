{"description": ["Vacationing in Acadia National Park turns you into a pioneer: Each trail leads to rugged, untouched land just waiting to be captured by your camera lens. Cobalt waves crash on the jagged granite slabs topped with spruce trees that jut out from the shore. Harbor seals sun themselves on abandoned chunks of bedrock off the coast as peregrine falcons scream down at you from the skies. Rocky trails and rustic carriage roads thread around the inland trees and ponds, begging for exploring. Needless to say, the park is for your typical outdoor enthusiast, with a huge focus on adrenaline-pumping activities like horseback riding, biking, hiking \u2013 even rock climbing. ", "For a very affordable fee, you're given free rein to explore Acadia's more than 47,000 acres, including all of its hiking trails and natural attractions. When you need a break from the great outdoors, the quaint New England town of Bar Harbor, Maine, waits for you in the northeast corner of Mount Desert Island.", "The best time to visit Acadia National Park is September through early October, after the summer crowds have left but before the temperatures drop below freezing. Visiting in March, April and May can be soggy \u2013 fog and rain are common \u2013 so you'll need to pack your waterproof gear. The weather is pleasant come July and August, but it's by far the most crowded season for the park. The park doesn't see many visitors in winter, but it's the perfect time to visit for the dedicated adventure traveler ready to brave the freezing temperatures", "Be overly cautious Whether you're hiking the trails or kayaking along the shore, never venture out alone. Pack layers just in case you get stuck somewhere and always let someone know where you're going.", "Watch out for moose Car accidents involving moose rarely end well, so drive defensively and keep an eye on the edge where the forest meets the road. Don't speed at night, especially from May to November when the moose are out and about.", "Acadia loves its peregrine falcons Although the repopulation effort on the Jordan Cliffs ended in the late 1980s, certain portions of the park's trails shut down each spring to protect these birds' nesting season.", "Rely on your own two feet Within Acadia National Park, you'll find 45 miles of carriage roads made for walking and biking, leaving little reason to bring along your own set of wheels to get around. A weekly vehicle will cost you $30, while an individual weekly pass will only set you back $15.", "Hop on the Island Explorer This free summer shuttle bus service operates from late June to mid-October and will take you to almost any hiking trail, carriage road, beach or town.", "Skip a guided tour With two resourceful visitor centers open every day during late spring, summer and fall, there's no need to book a tour if you're planning to visit during these seasons. For more information, consult the visitors center's website.", "While there aren't many dining options within Acadia National Park, nearby Bar Harbor, Maine, is chock-full of quaint eateries and bars. Of course, lobster is a must-try dish in Maine, and you'll find some of the best at Beal's Lobster Pier, Thirsty Whale Tavern and Galyn's. Many visitors also recommend the blueberry pancakes and pies from Caf\u00e9 This Way and Jeannie's Great Maine Breakfast. If you would rather pack a picnic lunch for your day in the park, stop at one of the few grocery stores downtown or grab a sandwich from a casual shop like Downeast Deli and Boxed Lunch Co. Keep in mind many Bar Harbor restaurants operate seasonally, so be sure to check the hours and closures before you go.", "The only restaurant within the park is Jordan Pond House Restaurant, which overlooks Jordan Pond. The restaurant is famous for its afternoon tea, popovers and seafood. However, be prepared for long waiting times as it's usually crowded.", "The best way to get around Acadia National Park is on foot. With 158 miles of historic trails made for hiking, Acadia is the perfect place to ditch the car and get outdoors. To reach the park, you can hop on the Island Explorer, a free summer shuttle service that transports passengers from Bar Harbor Village Green to a variety of park destinations. Should you prefer your own set of wheels, you can rent a car at one of the nearby airports, including Bangor International Airport (BGR), located just an hour's drive northwest of the park, and Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport (BHB), located about 10 miles north of Acadia. Guided tours and ranger-led programs are also available.", "A short but steep hike up South Bubble mountain \u2013 located between Jordan Pond and Eagle Lake \u2013 will bring you to Bubble Rock, a large boulder that looks as if it's going to fall off the edge at any moment."]}
