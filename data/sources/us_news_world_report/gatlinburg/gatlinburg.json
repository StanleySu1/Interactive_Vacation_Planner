{"name": "Gatlinburg", "description": ["With downtown Gatlinburg's main street leading directly into Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and a 1.9-mile hiking trail that begins at the edge of the city's development, it's no surprise that visiting the Smokies is the most popular attraction in this eastern Tennessee town. In fact, it's such a hit that the park has seen record visitation since 2021, when it reached its highest level of 14 million visits \u2014 more than Yellowstone, Yosemite and Grand Canyon national parks combined. This interest makes Gatlinburg, with a year-round population of less than 4,000 residents, balloon with activity during peak tourist season. With miles of trails for hiking and horseback riding, special events for biking and opportunities to view historical sites and wildlife like black bears and elk in their natural habitat, it's easy to see why the park is such a hot spot. When you're not in the park enjoying its natural wonders, you'll likely spend time admiring it from several of Gatlinburg's top attractions, including the Gatlinburg Space Needle and the Ober Mountain Aerial Tramway.", "But Gatlinburg isn't just a gateway to the Smokies. This small mountain town is a destination in its own right, and one that's particularly popular with families, thanks to kid-friendly diversions like Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies and Gatlin's Fun Center. To get a taste of local Gatlinburg culture, skip the kitschy souvenir shops and visit one of several local galleries in the Great Smoky Arts & Crafts Community to watch local artists and crafters create everything from paintings and pottery to handmade brooms and jewelry.", "The best time to visit Gatlinburg is between September and mid-October for cooler temperatures, fewer crowds and the beginning of fall festivities. The two peak seasons in Gatlinburg are June to August and mid-October through mid-November, when fall foliage is at its zenith. July is the busiest month of the summer season, while weekends in late October draw the largest fall crowds.", "Summer is hot and humid with average temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s. However, the city's slightly higher elevation can make it cooler than surrounding areas, and a quick trek up to the park's 5,046-foot Newfound Gap can drop the temperature by 10 or more degrees compared to downtown. Keep in mind that elevation is also responsible for rapid changes in the weather pattern, meaning you should pack layers no matter when you visit.", "Fall foliage begins to appear in mid-September at higher elevations. That, coupled with moderate temperatures, offseason rates and fewer crowds, make September a great month to visit. Crisp fall days in late October \u2013 when the foliage reaches its flaming peak \u2013 draw huge crowds, and visitors can expect traffic delays, especially on holiday weekends. Meanwhile, Ober Mountain Adventure Park & Ski Area draws aficionados during the winter months, with January and February being Gatlinburg's low season. March to May welcomes spring break travel to Gatlinburg, and you'll likely catch the season's explosion of wildflowers.", "Beware of bears It is illegal to intentionally approach within 150 feet of a bear in the park. For tips on what to do if you encounter a bear, visit the National Park Service website.", "Watch the weather Many secondary roads close during inclement weather, especially in the winter months. Check with NPS for the most up-to-date road conditions.", "Avoid the park crowds You can avoid large crowds during the peak summer months by visiting on weekdays early in the morning or in the evening (most travelers tour the park from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.). You can also stick to off-the-beaten-path trails and attractions, such as along the Foothills Parkway or in the Greenbrier and Cosby areas of the park.", "Hoof it around town Downtown Gatlinburg is walkable and there are park trails accessible from the city. If your feet get tired, take the free trolley to explore locally.", "True to its reputation as a family destination, Gatlinburg offers a bevy of casual dining options like breweries, pizza joints and barbecue eateries to satisfy even the pickiest of diners. In the downtown area, you'll find many regional and national chain restaurants if you're looking for something easy and familiar, including kitschy spots like LandShark Bar & Grill. However, you'll also find plenty of mom and pop spots tucked throughout the main parkway's several shopping plazas if you're looking for unique dishes like New Orleans-style gumbo or fresh grilled rainbow trout. If you're a fan of Mexican food, you're in luck, as multiple well-rated options are near the main strip.", "Breakfast is where the town's culinary prowess truly shines, with long-standing staples like Crockett's Breakfast Camp, Pancake Pantry and The Donut Friar serving up brunch favorites and sweet treats from sunrise into the afternoon. Recent visitors praised the breakfast platter at Crockett's Breakfast Camp, which comes served in a cast iron skillet, but others didn't find the food worth the sometimes long wait for a table. However, other travelers pointed out that the wait may be just as long at Pancake Pantry, though worth the delicious breakfast. If you stop by The Donut Friar, make sure to bring cash, as the establishment doesn't accept cards.", "This mountain town also boasts a few fine dining establishments downtown, but for a real upscale treat, head to the Great Smoky Arts & Crafts Community for a lobster pie lunch, quiet tapas dinner, or romantic steak supper by the creek. Your taste buds will thank you.", "The best way to get around Gatlinburg is on foot and by trolley. Downtown Gatlinburg is easily walkable and the town's trolley operates 365 days a year with free service to nearby attractions, including a connection to the inexpensive Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, trolley system at the Gatlinburg Welcome Center. However, you'll need a car to take advantage of the scenic driving loops or to access areas of the national park that aren't within walking distance. McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS) outside of Knoxville, Tennessee, is about 45 miles west of Gatlinburg and offers several rental car options. Taxi, shuttle or limo service to and from the airport will be pricey because of the distance. Uber and Lyft service the airport, but a ride to Gatlinburg can be expensive. ", "Fall (particularly October) is a popular time to visit Great Smoky Mountains National Park. To avoid the rush of crowds, plan to visit the park in the morning."]}
