{"name": "Jacksonville", "description": ["While Jacksonville isn't your typical Florida vacation destination \u2013 and it may not be your first choice when planning your trip to the Sunshine State \u2013 the city just might surprise you. Many travelers visit this expansive city to attend major sporting events, concerts and other live performances or hop on a cruise to the Bahamas. But Jacksonville does have the makings of a great getaway. There are more than 1,100 miles of navigable waterways in Jacksonville, which is more shoreline than any other U.S. city, and there are 22 miles of beaches. Just outside the city, in Jacksonville's Northside, there are also beautiful unspoiled barrier islands with white-sand beaches, such as Boneyard Beach, Little Talbot Island, Blackrock Beach and Huguenot Park.", "Jacksonville was ranked as one of the major \"Boomtowns\" during the COVID-19 pandemic (based on a study by LendingTree) and it's among the top 20 best places to live. The biggest boost of all to the River City is the proposed $2 billion downtown revitalization project, one of the largest urban core revitalizations in the U.S., which will bring interconnected, walkable neighborhoods and many new public spaces. Today, Jacksonville continues to flourish as a business center, though it doesn't draw the crowds of the state's other tourism hot spots \u2013 just yet. Now's the time to experience downtown's Tudor, Victorian and Jacobethan Revival mansions, cool neighborhoods and unique Old Florida charm without paying the overwhelming rates associated with better-known tourism destinations.", "The best times to visit Jacksonville are from March to May and September to November. These shoulder seasons see pleasant weather, as well as fewer tourists and lower prices than the summer months. June through August is peak travel season in northeast Florida, with hot temperatures and plenty of sunshine drawing beachgoers in droves. Winter, on the other hand, can see average temperatures drop into the 40s, driving visitors away and prices down. If you're looking for the best deal, then plan on a cold weather visit to Jacksonville.", "It gets cold here Unlike other Florida destinations, Jacksonville can experience chilly temperatures. If you want to hit the beach, avoid a wintertime visit.", "You'll want a car Jacksonville is the largest city in the continental United States by area covering 840 square miles.

You'll also find Jacksonville has more than 80,000 acres of parks, which is the largest urban park system in the U.S.", "Foodie-ism is on the rise in Jacksonville: The city welcomes new restaurants on a regular basis and the food truck phenomenon has taken over (Cartels Kitchen Seafood & More, Khloe's Kitchen and Holy Smoke Barbeque are a few favorites). Of course, there's no shortage of fresh seafood here: Try some of the region's signature Mayport shrimp at Safe Harbor Seafood Market & Restaurant in the Mayport area. You can also sink your teeth into fresh fish served Southern-style at one of the region's \"fish camps\" \u2013 these rustic restaurants specialize in regional seafood and offer laid-back dining experiences. One of the most popular fish camps in the area is Palms Fish Camp.  ", "If you tire of seafood dishes, sample some of the city's soul food restaurants.

Nearly two dozen breweries are featured on the ale trail, which encourages visitors to earn stamps on the corresponding passport to score prizes, such as a koozie or a T-shirt.", "The best way to get around Jacksonville is by car.
