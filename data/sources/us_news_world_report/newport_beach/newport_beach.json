{"name": "Newport Beach", "description": ["Known for its pristine beaches and high-class dining venues, Newport Beach, California, is a great place to vacation with family. Stretching along the Orange County coast for 10 miles, the city is known for the expensive yachts floating in its harbors and the prime surfing conditions that people travel from far and wide to experience. There are must-see beaches like Corona del Mar, but there are also plenty of other lesser-known shorelines waiting for you if you're willing to explore.", "Located about 40 miles south of Los Angeles, Newport Beach is an easy trip from the city. Newport Beach also boasts proximity to Disneyland, which makes it a solid home base if you want to relax on the sand after a long day exploring the park. The harbor area of the city is home to an endless amount of restaurants and shops, and the amusement rides on the pier are perfect for kids. The city is famously glamorous, and you may even spot some celebrities while you're out and about.", "The best time to visit Newport Beach is from July through September. The summer months are easily the best, and most popular, times to visit Newport Beach because the weather is at its warmest of the year and the ocean is comfortable for swimming. But, with mild weather year-round, this seaside town will make for a relaxing vacation pretty much anytime.", "Rent a car Public transportation is limited in Newport Beach, so if you don't have a car, you'll find yourself relying on ride-hailing apps, bikes or your own two feet.", "Rent a Duffy boat These little electric boats are a staple of Newport Beach life. Since they don't require a boating license and can accommodate up to 12 people, Duffy boats are a great way to spend an afternoon.", "Traffic trouble If you're renting a coastal house down the peninsula, you'll benefit from friendly neighbors and sea views, but you'll probably battle traffic driving to the mainland each day.", "Bike around There are plenty of bike rental options available in the city, and they're a cheap way to travel from place to place and avoid racking up parking fees. Try well-reviewed shops like Seaside Bike Rentals or 20th Street Beach and Bikes.", "Food truck finds Travelers rave about the wide variety of food trucks in Newport Beach, so you can get a solid meal without the price tag of a five-star restaurant. You can find a directory of some of the area's food trucks here.", "Bed down inland Though the waterfront views are stunning, they will cost you a pretty penny. You can save a few bucks by staying inland rather than on the water."]}
