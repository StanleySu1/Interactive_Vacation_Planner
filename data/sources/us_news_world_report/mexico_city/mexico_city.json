In short, it's best to plan extensively before diving in.", "Founded in 1325 as Tenochtitlan, the city was colonized by the Spanish in 1521 and later dubbed \"Mexico.\" Today, at nearly 500 years old, its pre-colonial history is alive throughout much of the modern-day capital. The city is overflowing with opportunities to study the country's rich and conflicted past. But it's also one of the most densely populated cities in the world, and although it does grapple with common urban problems like crime and pollution, many neighborhoods \u2013 including Condesa and Polanco \u2013 are as safe as any city in the United States or Europe.
