{"name": "St. Kitts & Nevis", "description": ["These lesser-known but luxurious twin islands in the southern Caribbean are breathtaking. St. Kitts and Nevis beckon to travelers looking for a mix of resort relaxation and picturesque landscapes with a touch of adventure and a dash of history. St. Kitts is the more outgoing sister, with the widest selection of restaurants, bars and hotels. Shy and lush Nevis showcases the opulence that has become this region's calling card.", "Seclusion might be the No. 1 draw (Nevis doesn't have a single streetlight), but there are many other lures. Take, for example, the sloping greens of Royal St. Kitts Golf Club. You want culture? These islands have it \u2013 just check out the wintertime St. Kitts Carnival or the music festival held every June. And those with a penchant for history will certainly find it \u2013 Nevis is the birth island of founding father Alexander Hamilton; St. Kitts' imposing Brimstone Hill Fortress was once known as the \"Gibraltar of the West Indies\" and the St. Kitts Scenic Railway educates travelers on the area's sugar cane roots. Meanwhile, those who come strictly for the beach can relax with a good book on a number of white-sand oases, such as Oualie Beach and Frigate Bay.", "The best time to visit St. Kitts and Nevis is in May and June, when hotels lower their rates to lure in travelers and the winter crowds thin out. But the peak season \u2013 December to April \u2013 does host Carnival, a party that might be worth weaving through the droves of tourists. The crowds disperse again in the summer months when the islands experience the Atlantic hurricane season. And keep in mind St. Kitts and Nevis' average highs hover around 80 degrees Fahrenheit year-round.", "Take note of the competition St. Kitts and Nevis enjoy a bit of a sibling rivalry.

On both islands you'll find plenty of meat and seafood, including the much-beloved conch. Spicy dishes, including Jamaican-style jerk chicken, are also very popular.
