{"name": "Playa del Carmen", "description": ["Playa del Carmen has carved its own Euro-chic niche along the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, making it a unique and fashionable place to plan your Mexican getaway. Sophisticated expats and vacationing Europeans relax at the beachside lounges, upholding this small enclave's budding reputation as the place in Quintana Roo to see and be seen. The area's nerve center is El Z\u00f3calo, which is well-known for its bronze statue arch that serves as a tribute to Mayan ancestors that lived in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula before the 16th century. Similar to Mediterranean beachfront towns like Nice, the funky little public square is within walking distance of the beach.", "Just off the square and running parallel with the shore, La Quinta Avenida features 22 city blocks worth of eateries, bars and quirky shops. And with proximity to the ancient ruins of Tulum and ample natural landscapes to explore (like R\u00edo Secreto, Xel-H\u00e1 and the underwater depths of the Caribbean Sea), Playa del Carmen caters to history buffs and outdoor enthusiasts alike. And of course, Playa's swaths of white sand and brilliantly turquoise water impress even the most selective beach bums. Canc\u00fan is Mexico's vacation of the past \u2013 today's savvy beachgoers choose the cosmopolitan \"Playa.\"", "The best time to visit Playa del Carmen is between April and May, when there are fewer people along the shore. Day temperatures hover between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, dropping slightly in the evenings. From October to March, the climate is generally dry and slightly warm.

Be sure to take care of the beach and surrounding areas. You should especially remember to dispose of trash properly when on the beach.", "Keep your guard up Shop owners on La Quinta Avenida and elsewhere will beg you to come into their stores, then pressure you to buy. Their sales tactics are harmless, but also high pressure.", "Budget for the photo package Many of the adventure activities and parks around Playa del Carmen, such as Xel-H\u00e1 and R\u00edo Secreto, won\u2019t allow you to take your own photos. Instead, the parks give visitors the option to buy photos taken by on-site staff. If you know you\u2019ll be opting for the photo package, expect to pay an additional $80 to $100.", "Go it on your own Most organized excursions to Tulum and Xcaret tend to be rip-offs designed to get you into the souvenir shops. To save yourself the trouble, catch a shared van (colectivo) for a more reasonable price.", "Playa del Carmen is largely a beachy tourist destination as opposed to an authentic Mexican town, but there are certain sensibilities and customs that could make your stay there more pleasant.

Playa offers a wide range of eateries, from simple local fare to sophisticated fine dining establishments. You'll likely encounter menus full of seafood, Mexican fare and even some American eats.", "Quality traditional Mexican fare is not as easy to find as one might think, but there are a few popular spots experts and travelers recommend. La Coronela is known for its tasty staples (think: tacos, enchiladas, guacamole, margaritas and more) at affordable prices. For succulent and fresh tacos al pastor, head to El Fog\u00f3n; for shrimp tacos and ceviche, check out La Laguna in the Fairmont Mayakoba. The town is also known for having a significant expatriate European population, evidenced by many European-style restaurants serving everything from tapas to Italian cuisine.", "The best way to get around Playa del Carmen is on foot, as most of the best things to do are located right off the beach.
