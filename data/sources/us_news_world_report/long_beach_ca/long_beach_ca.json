{"name": "Long Beach, CA", "description": ["If you're itching to leave the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles behind, travel just 30 minutes south to Long Beach where the days are just that: long. The lifestyle and pace is slow here; people spend their time biking along the streets, dining at outdoor restaurants, relaxing on the sand and meandering through art galleries and farmers markets. Neighborhoods like downtown provide an urban feel while other areas like the East Village are more eclectic and casual. There are also many daytrips and excursions \u2013 like a trip to Catalina Island or a visit to nearby Disneyland \u2013 awaiting you from Long Beach. After a day of exploring you can return to your sandy beach rental or your five-star resort, both of which have a place in Long Beach.", "The best time to visit Long Beach is between May and September because the weather is warm and the summer tourists are nowhere to be found. That being said, there is never a truly bad time to visit: Long Beach's temperate climate makes it a great year-round destination.", "Two wheels are better than four Long Beach consistently ranks as one of the most bike-friendly cities in the country, so it's a popular (and cheap) transportation method.", "Stick to the south Though it may seem cheaper to stay in North or West Long Beach, you'll be closer to tourist attractions and restaurants in the southern area of the city.", "It doesn't come cheap The city's prime waterfront location and proximity to Los Angeles means a vacation here can be pricey, so be prepared to spend a bit more than normal.", "Use public transportation If you're venturing to Long Beach from Los Angeles or its airport (LAX), taking the bus or the metro are cheaper options than a rental car.", "Bed down away from the popular areas While it's fun to spend your days at the beach and marina, pick lodging options in other neighborhoods to save some coin.", "Travel in the winter Visiting Long Beach in the winter months will ensure cheaper hotel rates and moderate temperatures compared to the busy summer months."]}
