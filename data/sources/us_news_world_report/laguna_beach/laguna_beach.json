{"name": "Laguna Beach", "description": ["Laguna Beach is what California dreams are made of. Visitors are treated to cascading, verdant hillsides, breathtaking coastal parks and secluded beaches throughout this scenic destination. All of this plus its small town spirit and historic arts community are just some of the many aspects that make this southern California spot one for the books. What's more, it's incredibly easy to get to. Located between San Diego and Los Angeles, Laguna Beach is situated right along Pacific Coast Highway, making it a perfect stop on your California road trip.", "Laguna Beach is the kind of destination so beautiful you have to see it to believe it, and when you do, you'll be in total awe of its splendor. But there is certainly more to Laguna Beach than its good looks. The town has a palpable penchant for the arts that can be found not only inside the many galleries that line PCH but also the streets; there are more than 100 public art pieces spread throughout town. There is also a deep appreciation for flora and fauna here. Whale watching is a revered past time, the headquarters for the rescue and rehabilitation for Orange County coast seal population is located here, and the town is home to plenty of wildflower-filled coastal parks, including one of the last preserved coastal canyons in southern California. So while in Laguna Beach, take time to immerse yourself in the local culture, soak up the coast as much as you can and don't forget to take plenty of pictures along the way. Though, considering how unforgettable the scenery is, you probably won't have trouble remembering Laguna Beach's impressive beauty.  ", "The best time to visit Laguna Beach is from April to May or from September to October. Both the spring and the fall bring far fewer visitors to the area than the summer months and travelers can still enjoy average daytime temps of 70 degrees or higher. Summer is Laguna's peak travel season and also when the majority of its yearly festivals take place. Winter will likely yield discounts galore but you won't be able to swim at the beach (the water will be frigid) and at night the temperatures can dip down to the low 40s.", "Beaches are a little different Because of Laguna Beach's geography (the town is set atop bluffs and hills), you're more likely to run into small, cove beaches than traditionally long shorelines. This means the walk to the beach will likely be moderate, down a long staircase and in some places, you'll be parking in a residential neighborhood instead of a parking lot.", "Time your visit to beaches around the tides Many of Laguna Beach's most unique beach features, including tide pools, natural beach pools, the pirate tower and more, are only accessible during certain tides.", "You'll need a car Other than Laguna Beach's free weekend trolley, there is no public transportation available in town. If you have the desire to go anywhere else aside from the center of town, you'll need a car to get there.", "Take advantage of the free trolley Laguna Beach's free trolley transports visitors to famous coastal parks, eight city beaches and through the center of town, including the HIP District. It runs every day during the summer and on weekends the rest of the year.", "Park along PCH Many city attractions are located right along the Pacific Coast Highway. Where available, you can save money on parking fees by parking along the highway and walking to your destination.", "Consider a vacation rental over a hotel Laguna Beach is an affluent town, and its hotels are no different. To save hundreds per night on a room, a vacation rental may be a better option for budget travelers.", "The best way to get around Laguna Beach is by car. Because the town isn't all that big and it's an affluent community, there isn't a traditional public transportation system here. The only public transit available is the Laguna Beach trolley which, with the exception of summer, is only available on the weekends and only takes visitors through the center of town. The closest airport is John Wayne Airport (SNA), which sits about 16 miles northeast of the town.  "]}
