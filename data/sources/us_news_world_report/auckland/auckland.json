{"name": "Auckland", "description": ["With picturesque beaches, towering skyscrapers, volcanic islands, magical hikes and a thriving hospitality scene, New Zealand\u2019s largest and most cosmopolitan city is a must for global explorers. Situated on New Zealand\u2019s North Island, Auckland, known as \"Tamaki Makaurau\" in Maori (the native language of New Zealand, aka \"Aotearoa\"), seamlessly blends majestic scenery with the hustle and bustle of city living. ", "For adventure junkies, there's everything from zip lining on Waiheke Island to leaping off the Sky Tower in a bungee-style experience. Sports lovers will enjoy the city's local rugby and cricket unions, as well as the national All Blacks rugby team. Foodies will appreciate Auckland's world-class array of dining options, which range from casual pubs to celebrity chef-owned fine dining establishments. And for culture enthusiasts, the city offers the perfect blend of Maori, European and Asian influences at sights like the Auckland War Memorial Museum and the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki.", "The best times to visit Auckland are from March to May and between September and November. These shoulder months offer pleasant temperatures and fewer crowds. During peak season (December through February), you'll contend with swells of visitors and high airfare and room rates, but this is the best time to visit if you wish to experience summer fun with warmer temperatures and fewer rain showers. Between June and August, both temperatures and tourism drop off, however this is the time to go if you\u2019re looking for a ski vacation in North Island hot spots like Mount Ruapehu. Before you pick your travel dates, you should note that the seasons are reversed here: Winter in New Zealand coincides with summer in the U.S., and vice versa.", "It's relatively safe Kiwis are known for their hospitable nature, so it's hardly surprising that the country has some of the lowest crime rates in the world. Like any city, crime does occur in Auckland, though, so be mindful of safety, particularly at night, and carry as little cash as possible.", "You'll encounter Maori words Maori is the native language of New Zealand and you\u2019ll encounter it everywhere from city names to news articles.

To avoid getting soaked during your travels, pack an umbrella or a rain jacket.", "Leave each place as you found it Tourists are asked to abide by the Tiaki Promise \u2013 a pledge to exercise care and consideration for the country\u2019s environment (by leaving each destination as you find it), people and culture.", "Stay on the North Island Areas like Waiheke Island, Tiritiri Matangi Open Sanctuary and Rangitoto Island are free to visit, but are only accessible by ferry. To avoid paying as much as NZ$95 (about $59) for a round-trip ferry fare, stick to attractions on the mainland.", "Travel in the low season The months between May and September constitute Auckland's low season. During this time of year, you'll find discounted airfare and hotel rates. Remember to bring a jacket, though, since the bulk of these months fall within Auckland's winter season.", "Eat in and pack lunches Many Auckland hotels offer apartment-style rooms with kitchenettes. To avoid high food costs, book accommodation with a kitchenette and buy groceries.", "Though most of the country is now made up of Europeans, Maori traditions are prominent throughout Kiwi culture. The country's All Blacks rugby team famously performs the \"haka\" (a traditional Maori war cry) at the start of all rugby matches. Maori \"hangi\" (or the tradition of cooking food under heated rocks, much like the Hawaiian \"kalua\") meals are commonly found throughout the island.

To learn more about Maori culture, consider visiting the Auckland War Memorial Museum.", "New Zealanders invented bungee jumping, and they're very proud of their extreme sports. Kiwis also take pride in their country's natural beauty. If you've ever seen any of \"The Lord of the Rings\" or \"The Hobbit\" films, you'll understand what they're bragging about. Though most of the movies' picturesque settings are found on the South Island, just outside of Auckland sits the Hobbiton Movie Set, one of the only remaining sets left from the movies.", "When visiting Auckland, keep in mind that several aspects of Kiwi life are opposite of what you'll find in America. Auckland's summer takes place during the Western Hemisphere's winter (and vice versa), and driving is on the left side of the road. Pedestrians should also make sure to look right, then left, then right again before crossing a street.", "The official currency throughout New Zealand is the New Zealand dollar (NZD); make sure to check the exchange rate before you go. Like Australia, New Zealand practice is to refrain from tipping unless exceptional service is given. Should you decide to tip, it is customary to leave approximately 10% of the total bill.", "Kiwi cuisine is all about fresh, local fare. In Auckland, expect to find top-notch seafood, plenty of lamb and a handful of signature desserts. Local seafood offerings include green-lipped mussels, fish and chips, whitebait fritters and bluff oysters. You'll also find roast lamb on most Auckland menus.

Walking is another viable option in the city center, while train services are also available. Taxis, rental cars and ride-hailing services are also available, but these are more expensive and prone to frustrations like traffic and limited parking spots. To get to one of Auckland's islands, you'll need to hop aboard one of the city's ferries.
