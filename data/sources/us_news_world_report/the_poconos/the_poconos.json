{"name": "The Poconos", "description": ["The Pocono Mountains, most often referred to as the Poconos, have long been a quintessential part of East Coast travel itineraries. The Northeastern Pennsylvania mountains' enduring appeal comes largely from its accessibility; the mountains are a roughly two-hour drive from both New York City and Philadelphia. ", "World War II veterans and their spouses first began traveling to the Poconos in the 1940s to take advantage of its secluded, romantic atmosphere. While honeymoon culture is part of the Poconos' history, so are outdoor and adrenaline-inducing activities. Big Boulder Ski Area opened in 1946 and brought the powder hounds, while the Pocono Raceway began attracting racing fans in 1968.", "Now, the Poconos also serve as an excellent retreat for families, with  kid-friendly activities like water parks and adventure courses. Plus, there are plenty of accommodation options to choose from, ranging from rustic cabins to all-inclusive resorts like The Lodge at Woodloch.", "The best times to visit the Poconos are in summer, fall and winter. Spring isn't necessarily a bad time to visit the Poconos \u2013 rates are the lowest during this period \u2013 but the weather can be unpredictable.", "You'll need your own set of wheels To fully explore the region and all its charming towns and stunning natural attractions, you'll need a car. Not just the most efficient way to get around, a car also allows you to experience scenic drives throughout the Poconos Mountains. Delaware River Scenic Byway and the Pocono Mountains Scenic Byway are two especially beautiful routes.", "Consider day passes Many area water parks offer day passes, including Kalahari Resorts and Conventions and Split Rock Resort & Golf Club, so you don't need to book a room at the pricey attached resorts to enjoy the slides and pools. You can also save by visiting the water parks after 4 p.m.", "Visit in spring Nature enthusiasts can still partake in most of the Poconos' offerings in spring, and March and April offer significantly cheaper room rates than winter or summer.", "Fall is a particularly scenic time to visit Jim Thorpe, when the town hosts its annual Jim Thorpe Fall Foliage Festival every weekend during the month of October."]}
