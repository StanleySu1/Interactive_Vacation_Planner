The towering red rocks and jagged sandstone buttes matched against an almost always blue sky have beckoned to professional and budding artists for years.

Over the past few decades, spiritualists have flocked to the region to take advantage of the numerous New Age \"vortexes\" with supposed spirit-balancing powers found here. Still searching for a way to satisfy your yen? Book an afternoon at one of Sedona's many spas. Traditional treatments with a local twist \u2013 such as red clay wraps and blue corn body scrubs \u2013 followed by a glass of local wine are great ways to relax after a long day spent on the trails.
