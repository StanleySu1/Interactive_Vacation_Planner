{"name": "Arches National Park", "description": ["Traveling to Arches National Park is like visiting another planet, one with thousands of natural sandstone arches, red rocks and landforms in amazing configurations, and light that seems to change every moment. The way the shadows play across the arches makes the park especially intriguing for photographers, who are drawn to capturing its enchanting vistas at dawn and dusk in particular. But Arches National Park is not just a shutterbug's paradise.", "Sitting 5 miles northwest of Moab, Utah, the park boasts 26 miles of scenic road and hikes for every level of fitness. Hikers can choose from a wide variety of trails, from short 20-minute walks to Balanced Rock and the Double Arch, to more remote and challenging treks through the Fiery Furnace and up to Delicate Arch.

In the summer, temperatures can exceed 100 degrees, which can make exploring the park's trails very uncomfortable. In late summer, violent storm cells often cause flash floods, which can be quite dangerous if you get caught unaware. Winter can be a lovely time to visit, with fewer crowds, though occasional snow and ice can make trails slippery. In addition, there are no ranger programs offered at that time. However, the visitor center is open daily.", "Pay to play A vehicle pass to the park costs $30; an individual pass \u2013 for a pedestrian on a bicycle or on foot \u2013 costs $15.
