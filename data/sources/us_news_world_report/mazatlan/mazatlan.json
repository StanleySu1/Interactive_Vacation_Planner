{"name": "Mazatlan", "description": ["Mazatl\u00e1n has a long history as a coveted beach escape, though often flying under the radar. The sidewalk cafes and scenic Malec\u00f3n are just as busy as they were when film stars like John Wayne and Gary Cooper used to come to town. While this \"Pearl of the Pacific,\" as it is known, definitely experienced a low point in the 1970s and 1980s, those in the know have rediscovered the charms of the city. And locals support and enjoy the revitalization efforts of the Centro Hist\u00f3rico and the refurbished museums and theaters just as much as the tourists. You should do the same.", "Mazatl\u00e1n may never be the celebrity playground that it once was (that distinction now belongs to Cabo San Lucas), and its beaches aren't quite as golden as Puerto Vallarta's gorgeous strip. But for that you can be thankful. Instead, this city has carved a niche for unpretentious travelers who want to enjoy the beach on a budget.", "The best time to visit Mazatl\u00e1n is the fall, specifically October or November.

Check out the city's culture website for information on upcoming performances.", "Hail an taxi instead of a pulmonia Catching a ride on one of those open-air golf carts (the pulmonias) is a must-do when going to Mazatl\u00e1n, but they do cost more than the regular taxis.
