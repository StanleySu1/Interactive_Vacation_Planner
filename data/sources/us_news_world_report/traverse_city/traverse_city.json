{"name": "Traverse City", "description": ["This little city of 15,000 residents may look to the naked eye like just another scenic lake town. But rest assured, Traverse City is so much more. This northern Michigan destination has, over the years, earned a reputation as a culture and foodie hub that has certainly added to its already awe-inspiring curb appeal. One of the biggest film festivals in the country, the Traverse City Film Festival, is held in Traverse City every year. Not only that, but its annual National Cherry Festival is one of the largest events in the country. Couple all this with its burgeoning wine and brewery scene and its abundance of outdoors offerings, including one of the few places in the world you can behold perched sand dunes, and you've got the perfect recipe for an unforgettable Midwestern vacation.  ", "The best time to visit Traverse City is from June to August. The main reason for this is the weather. During this time, daytime highs hover in the mid-70s to 80s and sunshine is abundant. Fall is another great time to visit for the colorful foliage, as is spring for beautiful blooms, but because Traverse City sits so far up north right along the lake, you can expect cold temperatures through the rest of the year. If you are a fan of snow, you'll certainly enjoy a visit during winter, when you can ski, snowboard and sled, among other fun winter activities.", "Bring layers Even during the summer, nighttime lows dip down to 50 degrees. Plus, the wind from Lake Michigan can make any day feel cooler than the weather forecast lets on. Pack layers, even if you are visiting during the warmer months. ", "Get to the beach early The beaches in Traverse City are relatively quite small. To secure a spot on the sand, consider arriving early to beat any crowds.", "Invest in outdoor recreation Some of Traverse City's natural offerings aren't always seen on foot. Invest in a bike or kayak rental or boat tour to soak up the available scenery.", "Sign up for a tour If you only have a short amount of time to indulge in the city's wineries, consider signing up for one of the best Traverse City wine tours. You'll visit a diverse selection of vineyards and tasting rooms and be free to imbibe as much as you wish with someone else behind the wheel.", "Visit in the offseason Since summer is Traverse City's most popular time to visit, you may score some travel deals when temperatures start to dip. Because fall foliage and cherry blossom season are also popular times to travel to Traverse City, November through March are a prime time for deals."]}
