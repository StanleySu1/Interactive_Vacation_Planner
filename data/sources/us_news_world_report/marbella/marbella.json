{"name": "Marbella", "description": ["A city and resort destination located along Spain's southern Costa del Sol, Marbella (pronounced mar-BAY-ya) is backed by the Sierra Blanca Mountains and fronted by the azure waters of the Mediterranean Sea. In between them, visitors will find luxe resorts, gleaming designer storefronts, see-and-be-seen restaurants, and remnants of historic Andalusia in the twisting cobblestone alleys of the city's Old Quarter. Although Marbella is a favored destination of the rich and famous \u2013 Antonio Banderas lives here \u2013 mortals are invited too.

", "The best time to visit Marbella is in September and October when summer's tourists have departed but temperatures are still warm enough for a dip in the Mediterranean. The months that span November and March see lower temperatures and fewer tourists, while April is another nice shoulder season of moderate temps and bearable crowds. Summertime's peak season attracts throngs of tourists, but temps and rates on everything from flights to hotels, are at their highest this time of year.", "The culture in Marbella is shaped by its rich, centuries-old history.

Some say it's because the locals were embarrassed about serving their regional dishes to travelers. But these days, the dining scene in the region is changing and chefs and restaurateurs are starting to welcome in others to its tastes and traditions. ", "The region's mild climate lends itself to growing olives for delicious olive oils, grapes for wines, as well as mangoes and avocados. Plus, the region's goats provide much of the milk France uses to make its cheeses. With its Mediterranean locale, Marbella also dishes up lots of delicious seafood, including anchovies and shellfish. Visitors can find these and more at the Mercado Municipal de Marbella, located on the northern stretches of Old Quarter. ", "While spending lazy days on Marbella beaches, travelers must stop into the chiringuitos, which flank many of the city's shorelines.
