{"name": "Nashville", "description": ["Nashville has evolved over the years and has become a city of a lot of things for a lot of different people. It's a popular weekend getaway for those based on the East Coast and in the Midwest. It's a foodie retreat for those who love affordable Southern cooking and international fusion cuisine. And it's a fun bachelor and bachelorette spot for friends looking to bond before taking the big leap into marriage. But Nashville at its core is a haven for country music fans. The bars lining Broadway (plus the famous Bluebird Cafe, which is about 5 miles south) host some of the most talented undiscovered artists in the country. In fact, Nashville is where many musicians \u2013 including Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Reba McEntire, Taylor Swift, Florida Georgia Line and Sam Hunt \u2013 were discovered or launched their careers. The best way to soak up Nashville's country scene is to enjoy the free live tunes at establishments throughout the city.", "You should also visit the Grand Ole Opry and the Country Music Hall of Fame, tour Belle Meade Historic Site and ogle The Parthenon.

Or, let a local show you around with a guided tour.", "The best time to visit Nashville is from April through October, when the warm weather brings this music city to life. Although December is quite charming with Christmas decorations at the Opryland Hotel and the Belle Meade Historic Site, winter is low season.

Over the past decade or so, though, Nashville has welcomed less cholesterol and more international cuisine to its dining scene; you can find restaurants serving Indian, Mediterranean, Mexican, Italian and Cajun favorites scattered throughout Nashville.
