And yet, Berlin is on the upswing. An afternoon of visiting a lively cafe, a biergarten or an all-night dance fest at a club will provide you with the proof.", "The best time to visit Berlin is May through September, when the weather is ideal for cafe sitting, relaxing in a park, and leisurely city strolling.

Temperatures tend to range from 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit during the winter. However, this might be the best time for budget travelers to score deals on airfare and hotel rates.", "Don't risk it: Stamp your ticket All public transportation tickets must be stamped at the platform, bus or tram before you begin your journey.

During the holiday season, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to visit more than 60 Christmas markets.", "Party in Berlin East You should take advantage of the city's lively nightlife, but you don't have to pay a fortune to do so.

Still, you can't go wrong learning a few German words: Guten tag or hallo for \"hello,\" bitte for \"please\" and danke for \"thank you.\"", "Punctuality and order are two characteristics highly prized by German culture, so be on time to any business meeting or formal engagement. When in a restaurant, do not leave your money on the table after receiving the check. Hand the money to the waiter and ask for your change.

You'll find these sandwiches at numerous street vendors all over the city.", "Finally, no trip to Berlin is complete without some (or lots) of bier (beer). Beer is a big part of German culture; the legal drinking age for fermented beverages is 16 (or 18 for distilled alcohol). Germany also takes the quality of its suds seriously. There are a number of regulations, known as Reinheitsgebot (literally translated to \"purity order\"), that limit the number of ingredients used in the brewing process to only malt, hops, yeast and water. There are biergartens all over the city, but one of the most beautiful, Caf\u00e8 am Neuen See, is found in Tiergarten. Don't forget to say prost or zum wohl (cheers and bottoms up, respectively).

Although service is significantly slower than the U-Bahn or S-Bahn, travelers can also take advantage of the city\u2019s extensive bus and tram lines.", "As with every big metropolis, driving is discouraged: heavy traffic and scarce parking are the main culprits.
