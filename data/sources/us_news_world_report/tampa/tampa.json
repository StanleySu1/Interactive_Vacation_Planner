{"name": "Tampa", "description": ["Tampa is having a moment. Not only is the city ranked as one of U.S. News & World Report's Best Places to Live, it's coming out of the shadows of its Floridian siblings and shining in the spotlight. Whether traveling with family, friends, for work, or on your own, there are plenty of ways to enjoy your time in Tampa. Free-fall into fun at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay or peek into the undersea world at The Florida Aquarium. There's lots of history here, too. For example, Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders stopped here on their way to Cuba during the Spanish-American War. You'll also find a few choice museums, including the Tampa Museum of Art and the Tampa Bay History Center.", "Then there are the sports. This is the home of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning and the new Tampa Bay Sun FC women's pro soccer team (kicking off in summer 2024). It's the namesake city of the MLB's Tampa Bay Rays team, and the spring training home base for several other major league teams. When you've exhausted all that Tampa has to offer, you can drive just 25 miles south to St. Petersburg for more art and some sophisticated dining, or west to Clearwater for its gorgeous sugar sand beach. ", "The best time to visit Tampa is from September to December, after school is back in session and before the winter crowds arrive. The months from May to August are the busiest at the area attractions, plus the weather can be uncomfortably humid. The months between January and April, though cooler, are a more expensive time to plan a trip.", "There's a busy cruise harbor The Tampa Port Authority operates three terminals to accommodate Carnival, Celebrity, Margaritaville at Sea, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean cruise ships. With so much to see and do, sailing into or out of Tampa is like adding an additional port of call to your itinerary. Explore cruises from Tampa \u00bb", "The beach is just a short drive away Beloved shorelines like Clearwater Beach, Treasure Island and Caladesi Island State Park are all about an hour's drive from Tampa, depending on traffic.", "The dress code is casual True to its Florida locale, Tampa's dress code is casual. You'll fit right in with shorts and flip-flops. But if you do like to dress up, there are plenty of options to do that, too.", "Consider a Tampa CityPASS If you're planning to visit more than a few of Tampa's top attractions, such as The Florida Aquarium, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay or ZooTampa at Lowry Park, buy a CityPASS and save on admission.", "Plan a fall visit You'll bypass the winter crowds and avoid the humid temps and wave of tourists who descend on the city during the summer. Plus, fewer travelers oftentimes yield lower hotel rates.", "Tampa's dining scene is enjoying a renaissance, and the culinary world is sitting up and taking notice. Michelin recently arrived into town and bestowed a number of awards to the city's stand out spots, from fine dining restaurants to a casual sandwich counter. The flavors of Tampa are as diverse as its residents and the neighborhoods in which they live. From Greek to Italian, French to German, fresh seafood to empanadas, Tampa has it all. The top dish to try when in town is a Cuban sandwich: fresh Cuban bread topped with Spanish ham, mojo-marinated roast pork, Genoa salami with black peppercorns, Swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. Any number of restaurants and cafes throughout the city serve the sandwiches, some with their own spin.", "More than a century ago Ybor City, on the outskirts of Tampa, was \"The Cigar Capital of the World,\" and where the Cubans, Spanish, Italians, Germans who worked in and supported the cigar factories lived. Anchored by Columbia Restaurant, Florida's oldest restaurant, the influences of these cultures are still found in restaurants and cafes throughout Ybor City, including plenty of options for traditional dishes like ropa vieja, spaghetti and meatballs, and many more.", "Other Tampa neighborhoods with terrific dining options include the new Water Street Tampa downtown district with its upscale dining (including several Michelin-listed restaurants) and chic vibe; SoHo, or South Howard, a walkable avenue jam-packed with restaurants; and Seminole Heights, the neighborhood in which independent restauranteurs have made names for themselves for more than a decade. Closer to downtown, Heights Public Market at Armature Works on the Tampa Riverwalk is a food hall with myriad options to satiate any appetite."]}
