Or, meet the locals at their favorite watering hole, HooDoo Brewing Company.", "The best time to visit Fairbanks is from July to August. Shoulder seasons, including May to June and August through September, are also ideal.

You can save money and still enjoy pleasant, cool climes in the late spring and early fall. For the lowest rates, visit during the offseason, which begins after Labor Day and runs through Memorial Day.
