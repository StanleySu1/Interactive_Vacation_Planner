I am a museum-goer and this was a dream of mine and it definitely checked off my bucket list. However, we just dropped by and didn't plan our day.  If I was by myself, my experience here will be planned out and it will take 2 days for me. But with company, we were only here for 4 hours-- and we just saw maybe 20%. This museum is massive and not to mention very crowded. Like you will be rubbing arms with strangers.  We probably went on a peak month (May) and it didn't help that it was so hot and humid.  The museum's AC did not keep up with the crowd's volume.  Like I said ---- this is a marathon. Here are my tips from my experience:- no need to reserve tickets! The line from the outside is still the same as people who reserved.  We were lined up and bought our tickets from the kiosks for the day. Voila! - if it's crowded--  then you will have time spent on walking slower, pushing through the crowds, and it's hot! Bring water!- stairs! There are lots of them and never ending! Elevators?? Sure-- you'll have to wait for 30 minutes. - there's an access to a mall (or maybe that's the Louvre's mall?) on the ground floor! It is so nice down there! - yes..... I will go back there again!

Until we meet again !", "rating": "5", "visited": "Nov 10, 2024"}, {"review": "Let me just say that when my family of 6 (4 adults and two toddlers) visited the Louvre, we left feeling: \"Eff the Louvre.\" haha. I love/hate the Louvre.  There is amazing art and historical artifacts that are housed here, BUT as a tourist this place is a FULL TIME VISIT.  One cannot just casually stop by the Louvre and meander from exhibit to exhibit. One cannot just take in each display with full reverence - I mean, you could, but if you do you might as well visit for hours upon hours, days after days, maybe weeks to cover the whole museum.  That is why I give the Musee du Louvre 3 stars.  I would give it 1 star if it meant people would stop going and I could have the museum to all to myself, but even if that worked, you still couldn't appreciate everything the Louvre has to offer in one visit.  This is a multi-day musee visit type of place.With that said, we thoroughly enjoyed every exhibit we visited until we got lost one hour in... then realized even though the museum offers elevators for strollers and wheelchairs, they don't offer access to the entire floor - and most elevators were out of order.  It was not fun after that. If you are without toddlers, I am sure your review of the museum is beaming with delight.  But for those with strollers or wheelchairs, this place was not as pleasant.", "rating": "3", "visited": "Dec 4, 2024"}, {"review": "In France for a day, it was a must-do to visit the Louvre.We made sure to reserve a time slot and buy tickets much ahead of time, so after getting to the museum a few minutes before the end of our hour of entry we walked directly in with no wait and started to explore the space.While I had expected the museum to be busy, I don't think I quite anticipated the crowd sizes. The hallways were crowded, the rooms were crowded, and it was very warm because there were so many people in every section of the space. It took almost an hour to work through the massive crowd in the cafeteria and order food - which was actually spoiled (I cut back in to return it and order something new).The crowd was so big that seeing the Mona Lisa up close just wasn't possible and we couldn't find the Venus, although we did enjoy many of the other artists (Rembrant, Ruisdael, Hooch, Teniers, Bandinelli, Rinaldi). Having just been in London a few days before I really enjoyed the way the royal jewels were showcased next to a people mover. It allowed close viewing but prevented overcrowding and I think something similar could have been utilized here.All in all, I'd say we enjoyed our visit but due to the crowds and the design of the space I just don't think we'd return.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Oct 23, 2024"}, {"review": "It's the Louvre, what's not to love.

It was originally built as a palace in the 12th and 13th  centuries. It was established as a museum in 1793. The Louvre is also the world's most visited museum, and is most famous for its most popular exhibits such as the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo. And this brings me to my two most desired pieces to see. You could never get through the entire grounds in one day, or probably even a week for that matter, so it's best to know what you're looking for in advance and target those areas. You'll be rewarded with other amazing artwork and architecture in passing. But any time spent here, indoors or outside is worth the crowds. Even the extremely popular Mona Lisa, which is like a Hollywood premiere of fans waiting to catch a peek of their favorite idol. Cameras raised, people pushing, until at last, you find yourself upfront with great photos ops as well. And as you make your way through a maze of seemingly endless paths, this humongous complex even has a full sized mall. You'll definitely get your daily steps in with a visit to the Louvre.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Oct 7, 2024"}, {"review": "We're both fans of museums and we had to visit Musee du Louvre when we were in Paris. You can get iconic photos of the glass pyramids prior to entering or you could do it after but your feet might be killing you after exploring the museum. Also, if you do it later in the day, there are more people there so that might prevent you from getting that \"perfect\" photo. I don't think there is any AI that can erase a sea of people lol. If you want less people in the background then I recommend going early. You'll see lots of people taking wedding or pre wedding photos early morning. We also saw a ballerina do a shoot that early with a professional photographer. The line for your entry time can be long if you enter in front of the main pyramid. I recommend entering from the Carrousel du Louvre shopping centre side as the line is much shorter. You are also shielded from the elements and it's much warmer at this entrance. Prior to coming, I saw this mentioned a few times so I followed this tip. It was spot on! The line in front of the main pyramid was outrageous when we finished our pyramid photos and I didn't want to endure the cold longer. I figured we had nothing to lose by trying this tip out. Once the Louvre opened at 9am, it only took us a few minutes to get in. Outside would have been, at the very least, 30 minutes of waiting in the cold. Most people come to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa but there is so much more to see and appreciate on top of your viewing of Mona Lisa. It's much smaller in person and the room is extremely crowded with people trying to get close to the painting for a photo or selfie. We took our time to enjoy what the Louvre offered minus the Egyptian displays because we were in Egypt not too long ago and saw many amazing things in their museums while there. There are many paintings, statues and artifacts on display at the Louvre. You can also get earphones for a free audio guide. Try to book your tickets from the official site prior to going. You don't want to stand in a long line to get in then stand in another long line to purchase tickets then follow a long line of people to enter the display areas. Musee du Louvre is a must visit spot once in your life!", "rating": "5", "visited": "Oct 7, 2024"}, {"review": "Louvre is AMAZING!!! No possible way to see everything in a few hours or even a couple days. You can get lost here. I loved it so much. It made me sad though to see & hear people rushing through here. So much history. So much richness. So much to read, learn, & experience. I heard someone say they wanted to run through so they could move on to the next thing. You can't do a \"drive by/drive thru\" of the Louvre. Why not experience the Louvre? Appreciate the beauty & all it holds. The ceilings are works of art. Do yourself a favor, get one of the maps when you come in & mark where you've been so when you come back next time, you know where you've been so you can go to different places the next time. 100% recommend.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Oct 13, 2024"}, {"review": "The Louvre Museum in Paris is not just the world's largest art museum, but also one of its most recognizable cultural organizations. Housed in a former royal palace, the Louvre's spectacular building combines classical and modern design, with the famed glass pyramid entrance serving as a symbol of the museum's historic yet contemporary character.The museum has a  vast collection spanning thousands of years and including artwork from almost every part of the world. Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" is its most famous work, recognized for its inscrutable expression and the crowds it draws. The collection is diverse, including Greek, Roman, and Egyptian antiquities, Islamic art, Renaissance masterpieces, and more. Classic paintings including \"Venus de Milo,\" \"Winged Victory of Samothrace,\" and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's \"Liberty Leading the People\" are among the treasures on show.Delacroix's \"Liberty Leading the People\" are just a few of the treasures on display.Navigating the Museum can be overwhelming. My recommendation is to set aside a whole day and compile a list of the collections you want to see, although they estimate that viewing every piece will take months! The museum is divided into eight categories, with each component providing in-depth insights into various time periods and artistic styles. The museum provides free lockers for storing coats, bags, and other items. Don't forget to visit the gift shop. It's located near the museum's renowned glass pyramid entrance, combining modern design and a welcoming environment for all. What actually distinguishes the Louvre is the way it combines art, history, and culture into a one experience. Whether appreciating ancient relics or immersing in modern displays, the Louvre takes visitors on a trip through time and civilization.

For those who don't know, in addition to being one of the world's largest triumphal arches, Arc de Triomphe is also described as one of the \"most famous and most visited\" monuments in Paris (along w/ the Eiffel Tower, of course:) After visiting the Arc de Triomphe in person, I can definitely see why so many people from all over, flock to see the Arc de Triomphe. It really is something special and I just wanted to share my feedback and a few helpful tidbits. - - -  special-ness specs: At 164 ft high and 148 ft wide, the Arc de Triomphe is MASSIVE! And at 1st sight, I was in awe at just how huge it was! (see the videos & pics included in this review of this historic, architectural beauty)- - - roundabout traffic hotspot:I also wanted to share this additional info about the LOCATION of the Arc de Triomphe because I had never experienced anything similar before and the traffic location design really adds to the overall experience. The Arc de Triomphe is located in the middle of 12 avenues that then have multiple \"lanes\" that go into a huge and definitely dangerous roundabout surrounding it. This roundabout is a traffic hotspot! There are no actual lines on the road that indicate the multiple lanes. Vehicles literally are cutting each other off to get into the roundabout and to get out of the roundabout. At times, it even looked like the drivers were aiming straight at each other...on purpose! (see video included in this review of my attempt of trying to capture the live action of the beautiful chaos) Experiencing this traffic roundabout as a passenger in the back seat of a vehicle is like riding one of those insane roller coasters that have you being flung from side to side while you're doing your best to hold on for dear life, w/ your eyes shut and silently saying a prayer of safety making it off the ride in one piece BUT w/ the added awesome twist of getting to experience your Paris driver making hand gestures that communicate nonverbal cues of frustration at his fellow Parisian driver! This roundabout will definitely have you saying \"oh sh$t, did you see what that car just did?!!\" ;))An experience that my hubby and I are still talking about! :)) Additional Helpful Info:- - - pedestrian safety_underpass: there is an underpass that pedestrians can walk through to reach the Arc de TriompheI would NOT recommend pedestrians trying to cross the roundabout traffic on foot because it is very dangerous w/ the amount of vehicles driving at any given time. And of course, despite the dangerous factor, I still saw quite a few tourists attempting to dodge vehicles to reach the Arc de Triomphe. There are stairs leading down to the underpass on the Avenue de la Grande Armee' side (see video & pics included in this review) To sum it up, a visit to the famous Arc de Triomphe is definitely a MUST-SEE!Till next time, Rebecca visiting from Austin, Texas (United States)", "rating": "5", "visited": "Jan 15, 2024"}, {"review": "What a sight!!!This is an incredible landmark!

We spent about 45 minutes in total there including climbing, enjoying the view at the top, and taking pictures outside.If you're not staying in the area, I'd recommend combining a visit to the Arc with one to the Eiffel Tower (go SUPER early for that one). The Arc is about a 20 minute walk away.Tip - if you need to cross the huge roundabout of cars, there's a tunnel underneath that's connected to the metro.

I think selling souvenirs is illegal because all of a sudden, while in line to go inside, all the vendors grabbed their blanket full of souvenirs in a swoop and ran away like roaches do when the lights go on. At first no one knew what was going on but we all had an idea after a few moments. Entry is free and they ask you to be respectful by being silent. They do check bags before you enter. You can spend as much or as little time there as you would like. When you leave, you're treated to a view of the city then you make your way back down all those stairs.

Value for money and a spectacular show. Review: (Some spoilers)The venue lovingly maintains the character of the old school music hall complete with many of the old fixtures. We took in the late night Moulin Rouge show with a bottle of champagne for two which we didn't finish after a couple of healthy wine pours at dinner (but did donate to three girls as a treat - bon chance mademoiselles!).The 11pm show tickets are thoroughly worth it for the 90 min performance with a 25% price reduction. The prices were reduced late night due to the cost of transportation from the venue late night. Pigalle isn't an unsafe area per se, but at 1am some of the typical late night city nightlife does become a little more intense... While many of the show's songs, some of the outfits, and 90% of the male dancers were passe/cheesy/kitsch, the venue, choreography, costumes and girls were fantastic. Most striking of all were the elaborate head pieces, which seemed to become more extravagant with each number. For any sensitive Americans still scared of naked breasts, be warned  the show is an elegant celebration of topless and semi topless dancing. Highlights of the show aside from the traditional cancan, were the transition acts including a magnificent display of strength and balance from a male acrobat, incredible flexibility from a contortionist and  an acrobatic combination of both from a dancing couple. Of the main show performances the aquatic display was excellent. Pro tip: buy the champagne package and get there 30-45 mins early to secure a good table with view on the floor, as all tables fill up and you're escorted to the first open seats.

You start by going through a metal detector and then you are given what it looks like a phone that has pictures and audio to follow along the tour.It's a self guided tour, so you can pace yourself and listen to the audio at your own convenience, it's so easy, there's indicators on the walls with numbers to follow along dialog and you can adjust the volume as well, I love having control and I can repeat it as many times as I want if I didn't hear it the first time.  The signs and most things are in French, English & Spanish, you do a good amount of walking, and lots of stairs at the beginning and end of the tour.

I tend to like this kind of art if it is the modern art from the early 1900s.  Some of the early modern artists that I liked were Rouault, Delaunay, and Rupka with Rouault as my favorite.  He used heavy brush strokes to give emotion to his characters.  Instead of creating smooth, realistic facial features, he would have different colored brush strokes right next to each other, adding emotion, and in a sense, disfigurement to his characters.  It was as if he was painting in a way to accentuate the characters flaws rather than clean them up.  The more recent art is less interesting to me but that is mainly because I don't understand it, similar to what most people would say.  Aren't there recent artists that paint real things? They should show some of those in the modern museum.  The top floor has the most recent art.  We quickly glossed over it before moving on to the next thing.

With this, it frees you up to enjoy the art without the burden of holding or wearing your coat. Keep in mind, Centre Pompidou is a very popular museum. The lines to get in here can get very long.

I notice a placard and immediately recognize... Paul Landowski! Les Fils de Cain is the piece and dates to circa 1903.

The man of the fields, the poet, the city worker.\" It is said that Paul Landowski was inspired by three Tunisian men on a random walk to nowhere, but somewhere. Serendipity?

Wrote our initials on the locks and threw the key away into the Seine below.  Such a novel idea.  It was fun and I loved seeing all the locks that lined the bridge.

Don't forget to taste Gelato. it's awesome and some souvenirs shops have really good collections.Many artists are setting up their easels to paint tourists or exhibit their work. Place du Tertre is a reminder of the time when Montmartre was the hub of modern art in the early 20th century; many artists such as Amedeo Modigliani, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh worked there. The Espace Salvador Dal\u00ed, a museum dedicated primarily to sculpture and drawings of the Spanish painter, can be found a few steps from the Square of Tertre.Also, the famous cabaret Moulin Rouge is located in this area. Here you can google and find Van Gogh's home (for 2 years he stayed there with his brother)Note:  you would have to climb lots of stairs to reach here. Better take toy train, it's running between the metro station and basilica.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Oct 17, 2019"}], "reviews_count": "106"}

I'd read about the show in the New York Times and was happy I got a chance to see it. That it was in a Frank Gehry building accessible via forest was a pleasant bonus.The Louis Vuitton Foundation is an art museum and cultural center sponsored by the Louis Vuitton group. It's a new museum, open since 2014, that apparently cost \u20ac790 million to build. Some of that money went to my guy Gehry (I'm from Los Angeles, so I'm just gonna claim him), who designed this beautiful, grand, sculptural building at the edge of the Bois de Boulogne, a huge public park. I enjoyed the walk through the park from the Metro station, even on a pretty cold day.We had timed entry tickets for 11:00 on a Sunday morning, and the place was very busy the whole time we were there. We waited in a short line to enter and had to relinquish our water bottles. Mine was a cursed disposable glass bottle I never even figured out how to open, and I spent a good ten minutes of my one precious life dropping it off and picking it up.The exhibit was amazing, a rare, comprehensive Rothko retrospective featuring 115 of the artist's works, made possible by the LV group's CEO (currently the richest person in the world) and Rothko's son, who helped curate the show. I got a whole education on Rothko even without the audio guide, which my friend said was excellent. The layout was intuitive, with a smooth narrative flow.We explored the rest of the museum, too, which included some background on the building itself, with some Gehry scribbles and models thrown in the mix. There was also a rooftop with gorgeous views.We stopped by the museum store on our way out and it was quite nice. I didn't buy anything, but I enjoyed browsing. There were tons of heavy, beautiful art books, including one for the Rothko show.This exhibit ends the first week of April, so if you're able to visit before then, you should definitely check it out.

The former is the setting for two of Hemingway's short stories.  Bar Hemingway features in the Sun Also Rises.  All that come here are trying to partake of an experience  that is not real. If you think Hemingway would come now and share a drink with you, your out of your Instagram mind.  If you don't understand, take another selfie it's ok, you'll be safe soon. The drinks are good and the food is very limited to cheeseburgers and hotdogs.  Bar snacks are provided ala Spain.  My advice: come and enjoy but don't linger: sort of like Disney.

I was iffy if the line would take too long but hopped in. I think I waited up to 15 minutes? A rather quick queue.I was sat at the bar and was immediately presented with some snacks such as chips and nuts. The menu is stylized in the format of a newspaper with some excerpts on the drinks. I ended up ordering a Ross d'Ecosse for my first cocktail! It was adorned with a very beautiful rose. The cocktail was champagne based and was very good! Sneakily strong so I had a bit of a buzz after just the one drink. I decided to order one more cocktail, being the Zelda.  It was a slightly spicy cocktail with flavors unique from any other cocktail I've had before. It was brought to me by Sam! She makes a great cocktail :) Everyone at the bar was very kind and I ended up staying to chat for quite a while! The inside of the bar has this cool ambiance functioning as an ode to Hemingway with an old timey feel. The cocktails are pricey at 35 euros each, but the bar is situated inside the Ritz Carlton!

Originally built in the 1600s as a hospital for soldiers, it now contains the tomb of Napolean! What a find.Just another beautiful building I was prepared to appreciate from the exterior as I walked by, ended up being an unbelievable must-see. All the cliche you hear about Napolean comes into clear focus when you see his over the top final resting place. I mean this is almost absurd.I am sure military buffs would get more out of this building than most, as it houses the military history of the highest order. It was used as an \"old soldiers\" hospital well into the twentieth century. A chapel was built there and the soldiers required to attend. However, it was expanded and became a recognized cathedral. Designed in a Baroque style modeled after St Peters Basilica, it's an impressive church and one of the best reasons to see the building including  Napoleon's tomb.Several of Napoleans's family members, French military officers that served under Napolean and other French war heroes are also interned here in various magnanimous and impressive coves of the building.

The gentleman was skinny and comparably short. He seemed to be in his mid 40 to late 40's and have less hair in the middle of the head. He looked up and frowned, shook his head then continued minding his business while saying something I didn't understand, which I assumed it was French. I was confused because apparently he was annoy that somebody would DARE to ask him any questions. Not being able to get an answer, I had to ask him again. He used a tongue - so arrogant that make me feel like he took himself as a king, finally said 2 words in English while pointing at me \"check there!\" I looked at the direction of his finger and found out it was the brochure, which was in French. Please remember, at this moment he barely even lift his precious head. I knew he intended to offend and anger me. But I controlled myself and said \"well you seem to be very polite.\" He said \"OF COURSE!\" Then use his left hand to drive me away. This tremendous rudeness almost shocked me - it has never happened while I was traveling in any other countries or regions. The fact that his rudeness was performed so naturally that it made think it actually happened a lot on this guy. I finally came back to the gift shop later. Unfortunately, the same guy was working as a cashier. The stripe reader on the other cashier's didn't work so I had to queue in line for him. I knew for sure he would humiliate me again, even though I still couldn't know why. So a female worker kindly helped me with checking out. During checkout, I tried to talk or at least to interact with him to figure out if he just had a bad day, but he just pretended like he couldn't hear me at all. The people standing in line heard it and all felt he was rude, he could still manage to ignore my existence. Anyway, as an English speaker from the US, I felt being shamed and humiliated on purpose on my first day in France. It was funny to realize that the world is more like a unit than before but there are still people who would act in this racist way - at least in my opinion, he seemed to be very upset about the presence of an English speaker that he had to hold grudge against me or whoever dared to interact with him in English.

Le Jardins de Plantes!I happened to come across the Le Jardins de Plantes as I was walking towards the Cathedral de Notre Dame after arriving at the Gare de Lyon from Lausanne Switzerland. It was a pretty nice walking experience, but should have taken the RER train, but thankfully I did not, as it was my last full day in Paris and wanted to make the most of it. I saw the signage for the Le Jardin de Plantes on my way to the Bastille - as it was pretty close, but not so much when you are walking it. Le Jardins de Plantes is a working botantical garden in the heart of Paris. Not so much a botanical garden, but just a wide open space, where people, families, and just anyone can come to - to enjoy and relax. The Jardins de Plantes is a wonderful example of how the city of Paris can utilize the green space to make life much more tolerable for those who live, work, and play in Paris. I must have killed about 2 hours wandering around the jardin and the adjacent areas, including the hilly spot where there was a gazebo.I myself enjoyed my time here. Away from the craziness of being a tourist, it was quite unique and nie to be able to unwind for a couple of hours just enjoying nature, people, and seeing how the local Parisians interact. It was cool to see kids playing and people having lunch on a nice Monday afternoon in October. It was a nice 12 degree C day, but the sun was out. Comfortable and enjoyable to be sure. The Le Jardins de Plantes is located directly across the Gare de Lyon train station along the Quai Saint Bernard. Pretty sure many public transit options are there, but I was walking it, so I didn't really need to think about it and tried to save money. The major attraction to the Le Jardin de Plantes was the fact that it was FREE. Yes, definitely FREE. That was pretty amazing, although not unheard of. Usually, parks are free, but you never know how much 2 euros can bring in per person. There was a food kiosk near the entrance on the Quai Saint Bernard, but I didn't need to use it.I saw a few people running inside the Jardin de Plantes, so that was cool. Maybe someday, I can return to Paris and do the marathon de Paris and return to the Jardins and just run here for the scenery. The scenery here was beautiful and the plants and flowers were very pretty. There was also some pretty cool statues along the route from the main jardin square through the hillier sections of the jardins and up towards the gazebo. The view from the gazebo was nice, but you really can't see much, but it was nice to be in one.  The building in back of the Jardin de Plantes I thought was the backside of the Les Invalides, but it wasn't. It  was a nice walk around the corridor of the Jardin de Plantes. While walking along with my luggage in tow, I saw that there was a photo exhibition by a Japanese artist hanging on fencing. It was pretty cool to see art in a park. I need to do that more often. The jardins are a great way to distress and just have that time to unwind from life. You're in Paris and that's amazing enough.My overall experience was good. Definitely appreciative of what Paris had given to me.Support local!B+", "rating": "4", "visited": "Nov 6, 2014"}], "reviews_count": "83"}

On Wed, Oct 4th we had a Montmartre Food Tour lined up at 11am which had been booked by our travel agent. OOPS ! It meant we had to jump on the Paris Metro for the first time.

There we met up with our food tour guide Nana and the rest of our tour group. We loved the leisurely walk to all the fascinating shops selling meats, cheeses, crepes, baguettes, macarons, chocolates and more. Our food tour guide Nana proved to be sensational explaining the history of everything on the menu incl wines.

We were in Belgium and left on Christmas Day to see if we could get last minute tickets to the Nutcracker that night as the website is not friendly for foreigners trying to purchase tickets. Right when we arrived in Paris two of our party took an Uber to the hotel while my mother and I took the bus to the Bastille ticket office. It is not easy to find and there is a fence. We had to go around some stairs and the opening was hidden around the corner. We stood in line for 2 hours. People behind us were counting and we told them we were purchasing for the 4 of us. On the Bastille website you are allowed to purchase 2 tickets per person. They got upset when my father and brother came after bringing our luggage to the hotel. They started pushing my brother and me. They got very physical. When the two line attendance came to open the doors the older ladies started yelling and pushing our family. They made derogatory racist remarks about us and when we told the line attendants they need to call the police their comment was \"That's not our job\". If that isn't one of their jobs than I don't see why they get paid at all. We finally got to the ticket counter and the person behind the counter was going to give us four tickets until one of the line attendance spoke to them in French and we were then told we were only allowed to purchase 2. We were told if we wanted to purchase two more tickets they had to stand back in cue. They ended up selling the two tickets that we were going to receive to one of the ladies that was pushing us. After everyone else got their tickets they happened to fix two seats and we were finally allowed to pay for two more tickets right before the performance. We paid three to four times the amount we should have paid for the other two tickets. When we sat down in the two original seats we purchased, insult to injury the older lady and daughter who were racist and assaulting us were sitting right next to us.After the show we talked to one of the managers that was there after the show and we talked to him.

Unfortunately after walking up and down the entire market more than once, we couldn't find any spatchcock chicken.  To say the least, I was disappointed.  We soothed our need for French chicken by purchasing a roasted chicken. It was just so-so.  On our way out, we stopped by a crepe stall and got a savory crepe with cheese, egg, and sausage.  Each crepe is made to order so they're super hot and fresh.  So delicious! A perfect French breakfast! I'm not certain that the March\u00e9 Bastille is as good as the Hollywood or Santa Monica Farmers markets.  The produce didn't appear to be from farmers.  Instead many of the boxes were labeled as being from other countries (not France).  I was also shocked at how many wasps were all over the fruit and sweet bread vendors.  It seemed to be perfectly normal and acceptable to other customers. But honestly seeing swarms of what looked like wasps freaked me out.  The cheese, charcuterie, and canned foie vendors were appealing but we didn't purchase anything because we really weren't sure what we could bring back to the US.

If I told you I walked in Napoleon's army would you believe me, still? Well to answer those scandalous questions one must first visit L'\u00e9glise de la Madeleine in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.L'\u00e9glise de la Madeleine aka La Madeleine is a Catholic Church founded by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1807. Earlier versions date back to the 1600's, however never completed until Napoleon united all of France. In 1849, decades after the fall of Napoleon, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, in his dying days, requested Mozart's Requiem be sung for his funeral here. A glorious event attended by thousands, overflowed past the giant columns and onto the streets of Paris, Chopin later buried at Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re Lachaise. This, after his heart was removed and returned to his native Poland. I guess as the top composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era you get whatever you want, right?! In life and in death. Le sighMy bed & breakfast was literally a stones throw from La Madeleine. I would pass by every morning and pass by every evening. One night I had a strange dream of Chopin so the next morning I curiously entered La Madeleine. Coincidence? Weird? Or was it his ghostly spirit calling me? I was stepping back into time, if that makes any sense. Not as bright as other Catholic Churches I normally enter. Yet, a calmness surrounded me. It was during mass, so I respectfully refrained from taking photos inside. I'll share it for next time! The exterior is breathtaking, yet seems misplaced. A friend from Germany says it resembles Greek origin. The architectural lines are Neo-Classical Roman. It reminds me of the Pantheon in Roma. The church is dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene. A beautiful oddity. In the end, I highly recommend a visit to L'\u00e9glise de la Madeleine. Attend mass if you can and feel the spiritual energy from everywhere.

Visit a fresh air market and have a picnic overlooking the Eiffel Tower. We opted to check out the market at Rue Montorgueil, which is located around the 1st and 2nd arrondissement, by the Etienne Marcel Metro.This market is typically open Tuesday through Saturdays, as well as Sunday mornings. Fresh produce, fish, bread, cheese, and charcuterie are on offer, with an amazing variety on display. In fact, I've never seen so many varieties of strawberries - delicious. Just make sure you know how many grams you're looking to get!While walking through the market, we were feeling a bit peckish so opted for a freshly made crepe. We had a nice conversation with the proprietor, who took great pride in his Brittany-style products.Ultimately, the GF and I decided to get some cheese and fresh bread to take on our picnic. We got a fragrant round of goat's milk cheese, which the cheese monger graciously sliced for us to enjoy. Along with a huge, hearty, half-portion of artisanal bread (yes, that's a half portion!), the tangy, grassy cheese made for a great snack. So if you're in Paris, don't hesitate to eschew the Michelin-starred restaurants and cafes. Sometimes the best things are simple. Grab some picnic fare and set your sights on the scenic route.We opted to go just west of the Louvre - in the Jardin de Tuileries.

I had understood it to be cold so we were wearing jackets.  It was not cold inside at all but very warm.  It was cumbersome to carry jackets and look at all the exhibits.  My advice would be to skip any big bulky winter jackets.  Once you go inside, it's stunning.  Take a moment to stare at the showcase surrounding the stairs and enjoy the views. After admiring the collection get in the elevator to the third floor and begin your journey. You start with a history of the Dior family and then weave your way through multiple exhibits including dresses.  NOTE: Do not stand too close to the dresses or try to bypass those who are taking a longer time as warning sensors will activate.  We were a guest to an orchestra of beeping throughout the third floor. The dresses are a sight to be seen.  It was an amazing experience and I won't add any spoilers but enjoy every step in the world of Fashion and see it through Christian Dior's eyes.   We did enjoy a break at their cafe.  It was uber haute culture and I felt severely underdressed but the desserts and the coffee were top-notch. For the four of us, coffee, drinks, and desserts was 78 euros.

Nowadays, they are vastly popular in many European countries, and many are open from late November to the first week of January.  They are also, inevitably, less traditional but more commercialized.March\u00e9 de No\u00ebl (Market of Christmas, or as we say in English, Christmas Market) at the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es is probably the biggest, most crowded, and most vibrant in Paris.  The market is HUGE and many people probably won't see all of it.  Wear very comfortable shoes and expect to walk a LOT!The easiest way to get there is to take the Metro line #1 and get off at the Franklin Roosevelt station. (Believe me, near Christmas traffic there is a complete gridlock worse than the 405 freeway during rush hour.)  Your journey begins by walking along the World-famous Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es toward the huge red, white, and blue Ferris wheel located at the far end of the market, approximately one mile away.Then you'll go across the street and walk the other side of the market back to the metro station.  Yes, the total distance that you'll walk is approximately two miles, not counting the many detours that you might take to venture into the various attractions along the way.The place was completely packed, vibrant, and lively.  The crowds came from all over Europe and around the World.  It was in the low 30's or high 20's when we were there but the Christmas spirits of the joyous families from around the World kept us warm.Of course a few glasses of vin chaud (hot wine, aka mulled wine) will also keep you warm but won't get you drunk. (The geek in me will tell you that the boiling point of alcohol is approximately 78 degrees Celsius, so a good portion of the alcohol in your glass of hot wine would have been evaporated before you bought it.)Food stalls were literally numerous and the selections, countless.  We sampled some French crepes, German potato pancakes (amazing!), Belgian waffles, among many other goodies.  And did I forget to say German Bratwurst and English bangers...Shopping was a bit of a letdown probably because many items were over-priced and lacked uniqueness.  A lot of the items there could be found in many places in Paris (such as Rue de Rivoli, just to name one) and at a cheaper price. But we didn't go there to shop so it didn't bother us one bit.We were there to experience the Christmas Market tradition in Europe; to completely immerse ourselves in European culture and their way of life; to enjoy the lively and festive atmosphere; and to soak in every ounce of the Christmas spirit that was present in the air.Joyeux No\u00ebl.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Dec 26, 2016"}, {"review": "What do I think when I think of the March\u00e9 de No\u00ebl des Champs Elys\u00e9es?Huge crowds; lots of militia patrolling the place - which created a wonderful sense of safety; people joyous for the season & lots of foods & crafts to entice the sensesAll kinds of mulled wine ( Gl\u00fchwein ) in red or white, they also had mulled beer of all things - we did not try but were all kinds of intriguedCharcuterie stands; cotton candy; lollipops; churros; an abundance of festival-type food to behold!There were also a multitude of cheese booths ( thank goodness! ) offering all kinds of truffle cheeses & holiday-colored assorted cheeses from red & green to blue & whiteWe definitely indulged in the truffle cheese as well as a good sheep cheese from the region ( can't remember the exact name ) but once we sampled it, we had to take it home with usKiddie playlands with small rides & trains, a visit with Santa and did I mention the HUGE crowds??Rite of passage for sure.......but was all worth it once we reached the Arc De Triomphe and could gaze back down the Champs Elys\u00e9es to see all the lighted-trees lining the streets and the Grande Roue at the end.

This tour was able to show us every major landmark in Paris and even some of the \"not-so-famous\" attractions as well. I will admit, I was hesitant to ride through the Parisian traffic, especially around L'Arc de Triomphe, but he was such a good driver/guide (as was my boyfriend) that my anxiety quickly faded away! This is a safe, fun, and once-in-a-lifetime experience that I would recommend to anyone traveling around Paris. Also, the service was extremely convenient - they offered to drop the scooters off right at our hotel room (we opted to meet them at their shop for our own poor planning, which is also an option)! They are SO accommodating. Keep in mind it does cost you a good chunk of change, but to us, it was worth every penny.

It looks so beautiful, although when I was there one of the panels of the bridge was covered with plexiglass so no locks could be put on it. As beautiful as the display looks, and as nice as the idea is, the locks have been causing a lot of damage to the bridges and some have even collapsed from the weight of the metal, so it's hard to say how long the city will keep them up, even as iconic as they are. My advice would be to see Paris before anything is decided about taking them down because they really are beautiful. I also advise you to come prepared with a lock because there are a lot of people selling them on the street and they're extremely overpriced (just like pretty much anything people selling on the street there offer). One more thing, if you're on this bridge, look for this giant antique looking lock, it's sitting at the top of the railing and stands out easily.

Pick up service was fine and our tour was fine. The problem came with the return. Apparently this company doesn't take traffic into account when you are returning from an excursion that is 4 hours from Paris. We encountered quite a bit of traffic on the return back, so instead of getting back at 9pm our bus didn't get back until 10pm.

Mind you I am a single female with my 17 year old daughter, and this was first trip overseas. We knew NOTHING about the taxis or the metro system and UBER was saying it would be a wait of 30 minutes.

If you book through them, do not use the pickup/drop off hotel option because the slightest delay will cause them to cancel it....even TRAFFIC DELAYS.

I guess they may have separate activity rooms for school trips. This science museum was pretty fun. I learned a few things and there were a good amount of interactive exhibits, including one social experiment, which I won't spoil for you. We spent about two hours there and pretty much explored the whole museum.Tip - the museum is a part of the Museum Pass.

By far (especially compared to my local place... Liberty Science center in NJ). Most science centers are essentially glorified playgrounds/ learning centers for kids. This place actually was more targeted towards adults and teens. In fact during the weekday that we visited, it was almost exclusively adults. The exhibits are extremely interesting and informative and I learned a lot. I could've spent at least an entire day here (in contrast to the art museums like the Louvre where I was bored out of my mind). The different sections are in good working order. Many exhibits are in both English and French (although there are some that are French only). There was a really cool interactive sports exhibit too when we visited too. We got the explorer ticket that gets you access to the Planetarium as well as the special exhibits in addition to regular admission. I'd say that this is worth it as the Planetarium was awesome.

Go do something else with your kids. Taking a course on coursera is better than this", "rating": "1", "visited": "Dec 20, 2018"}, {"review": "This is one of the most tactile museums I've ever been to. It's enormous, with several sections devoted to different branches of science: biology, botany, mathmatics, physics, etc. But the content is not etherally abrstract; it's what is applicable to the ordinary person - the car you drive in, the food you eat, the innovative design of your home stereo system, etc. And as much as possible, the exhibits engage your sense of touch and hearing as well as sight. In addition to the numerous exhibits, there is a steady stream of seminars (various topics) held throughout the day in different locations. Anyone can join the audience. The exhibits are quite accessible to tourists as well as the French, with most descriptions, explanations, and museum signs in English as well as Spanish. I was also impressed by consistent use of Braille signs and even some visual exhibits translated into a bas-relief pannel. There is also a planetarium with five or so shows. The planetarium itself is quite comfortable and the projection was good, though I found the presentation about the solar system a little disappointing - lacking in interesting content. There is, however, the Geode movie theatre for more modern scientific films. There is also a submarine on the site, the Argonaute, open for touring. This is located in the lovely gardens behind the centre. On the lower floor, you'll find a small but nice aquarium next to one of the restaurants. The Cit\u00e9 houses a large library stocked with science books, DVD/CDs and magazines/journals of all kinds. There are confortable tables and chairs for study, (and these are used quite regularly by local students and professionals). There's a kid's section to the library (as well as one in the museum proper). The ticket price for one day is somewhat pricey, but for only four Euros more, you can have access for one full year. It's a good deal (for a local) as you can't do justice to all the exhibits in one day. The library is free, but you need to pay a reasonable annual fee borrow items. The Geode movies are extra, about 10 Euros a ticket. The only reason I wouldn't give the Cit\u00e9 five stars is that, as big and impressive as it is, it's showing signs of wear and lack of maintenance. In one section I visited, about a third of the interactive displays were not working. In another section, several video screens were blank.

We went ahead and got tickets to two of the extra exhibits which were actually more than the normal price of admission.The exhibits were engaging for the munchkins and interesting for myself (an engineer).  One thing that I really noticed (and enjoyed) was that so many of the exhibits weren't just about science, but had an artistic angle.  The robotics traveling exhibit was more about the art and aesthetics of robots than the actual technology.They also had the standard fare of Earth sciences, astronomy, sound, light, etc.  All done in a very interesting and hand-on manner to engage the munchkins.This was an enjoyable and unique way to spend of our days in Paris.  I would suggest that for a family traveling to Paris with kids it would be a fantastic diversion at the 1/2 way point of a vacation.As a final aside, the second traveling exhibit was about the history of video games, which made me feel nostalgic and old.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Jun 6, 2014"}, {"review": "This is a nice museum to take kids - the -1 floor (one floor down from the ground floor) has a nice but incredibly  busy section designed to engage kids in testing all sorts of scientific experiments.

And eat well before - there is a McDonald's across from the front entrance and the food there is much more reasonably priced than anything in the museum. I liked the adult exhibits (we dropped our friends with children off on the ground floor and then had a quiet look around upstairs). The exhibit on the future of fashion was great and there was a section on existing but futuristic products that we liked a lot (though it is a bit like a high-priced shopping exhibit). Our favourite bit was the future of urban society where they showed the different living standards of modern cities and how architects and construction experts are planning to build more eco-friendly homes.

If you're an American living in Paris, get your fix at Rice and Beans or El Nopal or Candelaria.

We went, saw, I took my photos, and then we sat in a nearby cafe for a warm cup of Espresso. The travel price is very good in the Fall. Now with Covid it doesn't look like anyone will be Romantic here! Unless you are a resident maybe. One visit I was there in August. That was definitely before Global Warming. My daughter and I went to Paris in the Fall. It was a beautiful cool week. I would visit Paris again in a warmer month to go up in the Eiffel Tower again. I would love to see the city once more from the Eiffel Tower. The important thing is to consider the weather before you go. I did purchase a tiny replica souvenir from a Street Vendor. The deals on souvenirs are much better from a vendor than at the Tower. I have my little Eiffel Tower where I see it every day. In my opinion this landmark is the Romantic equal to meeting on the Observation Deck of the Empire State Building.

It has more to do with its role in history (mostly the French Revolution) than any architectural feature, and I found it to be ultimately fascinating. You got to see what prison conditions were like during the revolution (minus the smells and blood, thank goodness), and its re-creation of Mario Antoinette's cell was quite eerie.

Just to get out of the metro station, you have to go up a small winding staircase for what seems like 5 or 6 flights of stairs. Once you have made it out, you still have to climb the Montmartre hill and even more stairs. I would recommend exiting the Anvers Metro stop and taking the Funicular to the top of the hill to Sacre Coeur and then walking down hill to Espace Dali. It will take longer, but it will be much gentler on your feet and your heart. Espace Dali has an audio guide for \u20ac3. You will need to leave your ID or passport in order to use the device. The staff will return your identification as long as you return the device. The audio guide is worth it because it explains why Dali uses certain symbols (crutches, drawers, melting time pieces, etc.) in his pieces. It also talks about the artist, his life and his influence on art and society at the time he was alive.  Do notice that you pickup the audio guide on the top floor when you buy your ticket and enter the museum. You the proceed downstairs to the gallery.  After your visit, you will work your way back upstairs through the gallery store and leave the building. As you walk outside, you will pass the entrance. The entrance is the same place where you return your audio guide and collect your identification, but you will actually have to leave the museum and return to the entrance to do this. Because Dali's pieces are so unusual and have so much symbolism, you really should get the audio device. It makes the visit worthwhile. This is my second time to this museum, and I still find his work  and thought process intriguing. It seems like a lot of his work is actually for sale in the store gallery as well as art galleries in Paris too.

As you get to the neighborhood, you start seeing signs, so I knew we were on the right track. We went on a Tuesday at around 10:30 am or so. There appeared to be several areas: covered featuring stalls specializing in cheese, meats, etc. A majority of them appeared to still be closed for their August vacation. The street to the side were the stalls from fresh seasonal produce like mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, plums, peaches, and herbs. A lot of the stalls sell similar things so go around and \"shop\" if you can. A majority of them put up the prices so you can compare. Some stalls have \"do not touch\" signs where they pack the produce for you. There's also a flea market section as well. Most all of the produce looked delicious and they weren't all that expensive - some even cheaper than back in the States. We ended up getting a small eggplant, a kilogram of yellow plums for \u20ac0.99, and a carton of cute little strawberries. The plums were quite good and the strawberries were as well. The shoppers appear to be mainly locals but the shop owners seem to know other languages as well (I was arigatou-ed before we told him English would be fine). I can't comment much on the covered portion of the market (we're vegetarian and on top of that, most cheeses in France aren't vegetarian, especially at fromageries - I've asked because I love cheese) or the flea market because we had to walk back before our fruit decided to die under the midday sun.What you need to know: try to go early for best picks, shop around, they seem to be cash only, go here if you have a kitchen on hand (we did) to get some good produce and prepare a cheap meal.

Then, as the day goes on, the deals get even better - especially around 1pm (but be careful, in hot months the produce is going for cheap because it has gotten baked by the sun so it might be worth to pay more earlier).

We ventured out and found this local gem for lunch. We ordered the Mix Plate and the honey and milk custard dessert with red fruit. The Mix plate was an amazing combination of cold meats and cheeses with a light salad. This became our go to lunch order and La Pointe had the best plate out of all the places we encountered. The dessert was a light milk and honey custard that was refreshing and topped off our meal perfectly.After a few days and two disappointing dinners (one down the street from La Pointe), we decided to go for the sure thing and have dinner here as well. We arrived to breakdancers performing in the street just out side of the restaurant, so we were entertained as the super friendly hostess and waitress seated us. We asked what the best dishes were and she recommended the steak. He had a beef kabob and I had the steak frites. Both were delicious and well cooked. My steak was similar to a hangar or flank steak cut cooked to a juicy medium rare. The frites were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. No soggy fries here (see my review for L'Epicerie down the street). The steak came with an amazing pepper hollandaise that was addictive. The Pink Pimp cocktail I ordered was perfectly crafted and he ordered the local beer. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert was so decadent, I felt I needed a glass of red wine after we walked home. It had a perfect candy crust on top of sinfully creamy smooth goodness. I want some now as I write this.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Apr 26, 2015"}], "reviews_count": "24"}

There is a big food court that has many selections that are unique and restaurant like and not just a typical McDonalds or Burger King type of food court. The mall closes early but the restaurants were still open for business for a couple of hours longer. The bathrooms were a bit limited and stretched far across the mall so getting to one takes a bit of time.

I had seen video of it being created and was really excited.  We made it there and spent some time taking photos and videos and the sculptures are gorgeous, of course.  I believe there is supposed to be some additional movement but I could be wrong and maybe it is just the water spray from them.  Regardless, they were lovely to look at and I was very happy to have had the opportunity to go take a peek at Niki's art.  She was such a gem.If you're a fan, you can see her work in Escondido, California at Queen Calafia's Magic Circle Garden and about an hour north of Rome in Italy at the Tarot Garden.  Her work is intense and amazing.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Jun 9, 2018"}, {"review": "My second favorite (equally favorite, mind you) fountain in Paris has to be La Fountaine Stravinsky. Not just because of cultural roots connection, but also because of my love of modern art and all aspects of it.First of all, it just next to Centre Pompidou - win!Second, there is a little cart on the corner that sells best panini you would ever eat in your life (I assure you they quite different from American variations and drool-worthy-finger-licking-delicious!). Thirdly, it is just most fascinating fountain to watch! So, you got that panini, right? Now just plop on the seat along the edge of the fountain, get comfortable, watch and listen. 16 bright whimsical kinetic sculptures rotate, spew water or just look back at you...

It must be said that City Hall Levallois-Perret, built at the end of Nineteenth century as much, has a style unique to this era: high roofing slates, a wide porch, topped by a lantern which dominates the clock. We find this style easily recognizable in Paris, Vannes, Neuilly, and so on. But the time the building was also the time of emancipation and the struggle to establish itself facing the powerful neighbours Clichy and Neuilly. So Mayor of the time, Tr\u00e9bois commanded a majestic City Hall, size much more important. As for his lavish ornaments, there is a style Louis XIV very present. Within you will see that everything is monumental: a grand double staircase revolution that leads to the Salons d'Honneur, long forty-four meters, decorated sumptuous frescoes painted at different times and lit by twelve beautiful chandeliers, a room richly decorated Council and having the particularity to own forums in height to accommodate a wide public. The hall marriages added belatedly by the current mayor (elected in 1983) is magnificent, in the style candy box!
