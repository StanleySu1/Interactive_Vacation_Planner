The greedy production tries to fill in as many people into the place as possible, making it difficult to follow characters, not to mention immerse into the play. People get very aggressive to see something, and when you get into the small spaces, you see nothing. I was pushed, stepped on, and thrown into the wall. This production should be more intimate.  Hundreds of people ran around the house trying not to lose character and not to mess with other hundred people. The whole thing is an unorganized mess.

It was amazing on so many levels. The acting, the art direction, the soundtrack, the creative plot lines intertwined, etc. I won't give it five stars because maybe they shouldn't allow so many people in. My session was a mob scene of people running from and to all directions. At some point, I was elbowed in the face by this huge guy who didn't even apologize (in his defense, it was clearly not intentional; he was part of this deranged group chasing Macbeth). I was already emotionally triggered and alone, so I quietly cried under my mask, lol. I had to slightly lift it for a few seconds to dry out my tears, then I soldiered on. When I got home, I saw a little bruise on the left side of my nose (the mask had been pressed against it hard). Nothing too serious, though. Would I still recommend it? Absolutely. I wish they had fewer people in so the experience would be more enjoyable for the not-so-aggressive guests. Unfortunately, this problematic cap won't allow me to give it five stars. Ending it on a more positive note, I'm still emotionally and intellectually processing it. It's incredible.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Sep 11, 2024"}, {"review": "So this review may be a moot point because Sleep No More is closing in April (after multiple extensions).  But because there are more events at the McKittrick hotel, and Sleep No More will inevitably be replaced by a new and innovative production, I want to offer my take.People seem to either love or hate this show.  And maybe I had a better experience than most because I purchased Maximillian's tickets, meaning I skipped the line, and had an early entry time.There are some people reporting that others were crowding, elbowing, and shoving.  While some main characters amassed a large following (I avoided those situations), I didn't encounter anyone being rude or physical.Also, the guy saying people are elbowing their way to the front for instagram pics?  Your phone is locked in a bag the whole time.  No pics inside.You have to have to be open and be in a creative/receptive state of mind.  This is loosely based upon Macbeth, as well as an Alfred Hitchcock movie and a historical event.  You're not going to get a cohesive storyline.  But it would be helpful to hit the Google, read some tips on Sleep No More, and check out the cliffs on Macbeth.The other thing people have to realize, you can choose to just meander the hotel and become just another one of its ghostly residents.  There are so many drawers to open, secret letters to read, little hidden messages.  You don't have to run after an actor the whole time.I also found that following smaller, lesser known characters could be more rewarding than following the main characters.  And often these characters could lead you to some important revelations about the big picture.There are also subtle cues.  For example, I followed the hotel desk manager, a seemingly negligible character.  But he is the connector of several characters.  He ran to a back room and pulled a chair out for himself to sit.  He also happened to pull out the chair next to him.  I took that as a cue to sit down.  Once he finished his drawing and writing, he handed it to me.Another actor lightly brushed a chair off, indicating it was time for one of us to sit down as he belted out his soulful tune, \"Is That All There Is?\"This time I was with a friend who did not understand the concept, and would not have functioned well being separated from me.  I had a good time, but felt absolutely positive that I would have had a better time and explored more if I was solo.  So I'm going back next month alone!  Don't work to stay with your friends or group.  It'll be more fun to compare experiences after it's over!The show runs on a one hour loop over three hours, so you have a lot of opportunities to explore different characters and storylines, or you can follow three characters from start to finish.And dress comfortably.  Don't be like the woman who wore shoes with a heel, so she clip-clopped wherever she went.  Really, you're in the dark and you're going to get hot and sweaty running up and down stairs.  People were dressed in all kinds of clothes.  And yes, we all wear masks to differentiate us from the actors.  It felt exclusive and weird and fun.At any time during the show, you can retreat to the Manderley bar (another nod to Hitchcock) to rest of have drinks.  If you have Maximillian tickets, you have a reserved table.  They have jazz during and shortly after.  And then before closing, they have a 45 minute improv session with a really funny, witty comedian.  We laughed until we cried.So in closing:  pick early time slots, explore the hotel without focusing on the main characters, sometimes auxiliary characters are more interesting or will lead you to bigger things, dress comfortably, don't try to stay with your group, be open minded, pick up on subtle cues from the actors, don't miss out on the bar, jazz, and improv show.  Oh, and there is a compulsory bag check, so the less you bring the better.  And if you can afford the highest ticket level, it's quite the treat.

What was neat is that they actually have outside restaurants selling food there like Emmy squared pizza and tacos Fonda. They also have a full bar. Our private section was very small, which made food a bit challenging. It felt like sitting inside of a batting cage. The tables were hardly bag enough to hold two plates. Even with the food stands, there was no space to put anything and it felt too tight. We even had to put some food on the seats which felt  unsanitary.  That was probably my biggest complaint. The food was tasty though. Not your typical bar food you get at a lot of recreation places.After we finished eating, it was time for golf. The mini golf range has nine holes. It's really cool looking and has the feel of being at a fair or carnival. The holes were all equally challenging I thought  (they don't progress in difficulty). You play in teams and they give u a club a score sheet to keep score. Even when we came on a weekday it was pretty crowded. They stagger people by assigning an entrance time, but even so we ended up waiting at some stations while the people in front of us finished. The golf was probably the nicest part of the experience for me. Finally, we ended the night with some selfies. After completing the holes.

And, there's a place to style a blue muppet with hair, eyes, and clothes.Yes - there's Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Miss Piggy, the Swedish Chef, as well as Henson's characters from Fraggle Rock, The Land of Gorch, The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth!But more than that - there's the innovative technology and systems this master developed to bring them to life on camera. Various recordings show Henson's influences, how he pulled things together, and the final product! All wow!For me, the other big MoMI draw is the original permanent (enhanced further) \"Behind the Screens\" exhibit, which I marvel at. One floor that includes the earliest Magic Lantern, Zoetrope and Phenakistoscope both traces film and TV production and projection technology advancements plus provides interactive opportunities: create stop motion animation, practice dubbing, test out adding sound effects, and understand the complexity of pulling together multi-camera live sports. Another floor includes: make up and prosthetics, sets, costumes, in addition to the licensed products - which include a Star Trek Ken and Barbie (if that's still a thing for you after Barbenheimer).Video game and digital media enthusiasts will enjoy at MoMI early video game technology, including some you can play. Also underway is a digital interactive exhibit with work from Auriea Harvey.Two separate additional pieces caught my eye. The \"Mr. Yellow Sweatshirt\" short (thru May 5th) shows a pre-OMNY Birdseye view of a hectic subway entrance with non-stop Metro card swipes and no real jumping the turnstile. \"Fiona Tan: Footsteps\" using 100+ year old footage with reading of contemporary letters reminded me of Chantal Akerman's classic \"News from Home.\" (I found in Tan's case the time capsule clips chosen, which were not her own, mesmerizing, however the letters she added a disconnect.)Keep in mind, MoMI offers a good screening program, so check the calendar. I'll likely mention the museum to all my out-of-town visitors, especially to take advantage of that Henson exhibit!

We went here again today (after 5+ years) and it's as great as I remember it being back then. Admission is free for NYC teachers with ID and $20 for regular admission (adult).  There is a small coffee / tea and snack bar. We had a Kind bar for $2+tax each. (Not bad at all.)The Jim Henson exhibit is a permanent exhibit (I believe) and it was $5 extra per person for a guided tour. The tour guide was knowledgeable and although the tour ended earlier than the 45 minutes it was supposed to be, it was still worth it.  Loved learning about the intricacies of creating and bringing the puppets characters to life on screen!  Such craft and skill, with much more limited technology than today!  Super impressive.  I was sad learning of Jim's sudden passing at only 53 from sepsis!  Imagine what else he could have created and had a vision for if he lived well into his 80s or 90s.

In my experience, this is as good as farmers markets get on the east coast.Admittedly, we don't have the variety of fruits and vegetables that my parents do at their weekly farmers market in La Jolla. Of all of the greenmarkets I've visited throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn, the Union Square location's open most days of the week, with Saturdays being their flagship market.My personal faves include mushroom from Bulich Farms, Knoll Krest's eggs and pastas, and PE & DD Seafood's sea scallops. I also regularly snag pork butts from Roaming Acres (go early; they routinely sell out) and huge cuts of brisket from Grazin' Angus to throw in my sous vide.Although the greenmarket's open year-round, it really flourishes in the warmer seasons. Beginning in late spring, ramps show up. My friends now tease me mercilessly around this time of year, because they know as soon as those wild spring onions pop up, I can't stop gushing about them for weeks. Summer brings out decadently sweet peaches; crisp, refreshing watermelon; and bountiful heirloom tomatoes. You're pretty limited on fresh veg in the winter, but carrots and root vegetables make for great roasts along with the high quality meats.Plus, the Greenmarket team does a phenomenal job at programming. I haven't intentionally attended any events, but they routinely put on cooking demos, book signings, and more. Whoever's handling their social media must be inspired.Last, but not least, I make a weekly stop to pitch my compost at this location. The LES Ecology Center has a food scrap dropoff site here every day the market's open and I probably shave off 50% of my total household garbage by freezing and composting my coffee grounds, eggshells, and more.In short, the greenmarket is probably my favorite perk of living in the neighborhood and Union Square is so much richer for its presence!", "rating": "4", "visited": "Oct 17, 2024"}, {"review": "Union Square Greenmarket is, in my opinion, the best and most consistent farmers market I've been to over the years.

Had artichoke and chicken. Beef arepa - really good. A bit spicy. Had a lot of beef brisket. Cheese inside the arepa. Really enjoyed this. Beef arepa from Ay Cach___ - forgot the name and photo for this one, but their arepa are different. It has corn kernels inside and it was gooey and soft with cheese filling.

This time, I happen to be traveling with friends and they agreed to experience the magic with me.We attended the 7pm show.  The theater opens at 6:30 to let guests in, get settled, buy things off of the concession stands, and maybe take a fee photos/take in the scene.  There were 2 lines and 3 entrances which starts with a bag check.  If you have a big bag, it's useful to ensure it's ready and open for checks.  Security personnel dressed in Hogwarts grab will remind you about the bag and direct you to smoothly enter the premises.Once inside, there are props with which to take photos with including a telephone booth and a space with the house colors and banners as props.  There are bar areas from which refreshments may be purchased, including some adult 'potions' to enjoy during the performance.  They also have delivering service to your seats should you wish to not spend time being in line ordering.Despite my previous doubts, I had a surprisingly magnificent time!  The acting was fantastic, funny, and delightful.  In addition, the special effects were excellent that I have forgotten I was in a theater watching the scenes unfold before my very eyes rather than watching a filmed performance.  They did a magnificent job with the casting, the choreography, and the special effects delivering a neatly wrapped beautifully executed show.  My favorite part was easily the floating dementors that came from above.  Creepy and wonderful at the same time!  They glided over the audience which made it even more delightful.  I was also impressed by how limber and balanced the actors were sliding at a speed from the fireplaces and standing up quickly after getting shoot out without looking like they were struggling.  I cannot stress enough how well done the special effects were.The show is long, lasting over 3 hours with a 15 minute intermission. Honestly though, it's a time bargain compared to the 2-part version and I felt like the show was condensed enough to include all the major events from the original script.  I think overall, the show was very well done and can see it lasting a long time on Broadway.

When I was a kid I remember this area of 10th and 34th and all I can say I remember was a McDonald's where you could actually park at if you were dining in and if there were parking spots available.  Fast forward 35 or so years and now this place is completely different.  I mean just prior to my 2018 visit when this place was still being built.  Our first visit to the Shops at Hudson was in November of 2022 when it was by then well established.  This area is completely rebuilt and this mall being at the base of a skyscraper is a nice addition to what is central to the area as a whole.  The area is heavily revitalized and complimented in the fact that yes you are in between Clinton and Chelsea in a completely modernized pocket of the west side.  The Vessel although closed for now is still there but the marvel of the area as a whole is the top of the High Line too.  About the Shops though although the area is large and there are seemingly multiple entrances the corner entrance at 10th and 33rd was the one we used both times since coming here.  The mall itself is on multiple levels with the higher end shops like Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Van Cleef etc being on the level in the same area while Muji and Uniqlo are on the same level.

I thought the movie began at 6pm so I arrived at that time and had almost two hours to look around. I chilled in the big beautiful hammocks And walked the vineyard. Though pizza and wine was included in my ticket I ordered the watermelon frose which was so delicious and cheese. The spread arrived in picnic aesthetic  which was so cute. The movie started at sun down and it got chilly fast. They provide blankets at no additional cost if needed. The pizza was so good! It was a nice vibe with the beautiful skyline in the background.

Aside from the two slices of pizza we each received, we went with a bottle of Saratoga water, prosciutto and their cheese and crackers. These additions came out in a nice basket, along with glasses for drinking. Service was great and super friendly. Would definitely recommend for date night or with a small group of friends. Only down side was the volume not being very loud for us sitting in the back.

It's just so fun and a totally different environment than other rooftops you'll find in the city. They have hammocks and games, you can really spend a good amount of time there. Not to mention the wine is decent, and they have a variety of flights, with impeccable views of the city on a nice day. The only thing about this place that is super frustrating is the way they do reservations. It's honestly the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. When I went here pre pandemic you could come and go whenever and there was no cover charge. Now they have this super bizarre thing where you have to make a reservation that's $15 per person in particular time windows, and there's about an hour between time windows that you can't go. So it makes going there requiring more planning than what feels necessary for going to a rooftop, and the cover charge is annoying, especially when there didn't used to be one. But even with the bizarre reservations and cover charge it's really worth going!

I signed up on the 1iota website and wasn't sure if I'd get in, but I kept my afternoon open just in case and received an email the day before the taping with instructions on when/where to show up.Checkin was stated to be strictly between 3:15-3:45, I checked in near the end and went through multiple check points as well as a security screening. Each group of 1-4 receives tickets with letter(s) or a number on the back, and after hanging out in the waiting room for a bit, all the groups are called up in (I assume) the same order that you arrived to head to the studio!

Knowing what days I would be in New York, I had been monitoring the site for when new shows were posted. Pro tip: Check the @FallonTix Twitter account for the heads-up of when the ticket waitlist will open. I put in a few requests for various days and about a month later (mid-June, about two weeks before the show), I received an email notification to claim my tickets. The tickets were confirmed and we were off to see Jimmy Fallon!You must be fully vaxxed in order to attend, and you have to bring your physical vaccination card to the show (there are also a few other digital verification methods that are accepted). The ticket didn't say much about a dress code, just that you should dress nicely because you could be on tv. It also said no large bags, and check-in was from 3-3:30pm for a 5pm taping. Your tickets will be released to the stand-by line if not checked in by 3:30pm.We had some trouble finding the check-in spot at Rockefeller Center, but the security guards are used to the confused tourists roaming about and are quick to direct you to where you need to be. As other Yelpers have mentioned, they check your ID, vax card, and tickets multiple times. These were checked at the bottom of the stairs, at the top of the stairs, in line, and at actual check-in.At check-in, they give you a physical colored ticket for the day's show with an assigned letter or number on it. Everyone in your group will have the same letter or number, and this is how they'll call people into the studio. On our day, single letters were seated first/closest to the stage (alphabetical order), followed by double letters, then numbers (numerical order). They do collect the tickets back prior to entering the studio, so be sure to snap your souvenir pics before heading upstairs. After getting your ticket, you'll go through the security screening/metal detectors and then wait in the Peacock Lounge. They have couches here and flash pictures of Jimmy Fallon and his special guests while you wait. This is also your last chance to go to the bathroom or get a sip from the water fountain before the taping. It's also your last chance to use your phones; once you go upstairs, your phones must be off (not in airplane mode, not in do not disturb, OFF).At around 4:15pm, the numbers/letters were called and we were escorted into the studio. The warm-up guy was already going and the band was playing by the time we got seated around 4:45pm (we were #36 out of A-Z, AA-ZZ, and 1-50). I'm not sure what we missed, or if there was some intro of sorts about when to clap, laugh, ooo and awww, etc., but the show got underway a little after 5pm and then it was go, go, go. They did re-tape bits when Jimmy thought he could do it better or when the crew missed filming an interaction, but for the most part, they filmed each segment right on through. We were able to watch the show later on in the evening when they aired it, so it's interesting to see what makes the cut and what gets cut.I had been checking the announced guests the week before to get an idea of who we would see, but these are subject to change. The 2/3 guests changed day-of, but I'm not complaining. We went to see The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon so the guest stars were just a bonus. Plus, we got to see The Roots play!After the taping ended, we were conveniently let out at the NBC gift shop and handed a 10% off coupon. We finished the taping around 6:15pm, which was just in time for us to grab a quick bite and see our 7pm show. I could've done with a little more communication about the taping experience, but then again, it's pretty basic - just applaud when the \"applause\" light turns on, have fun, and no heckling.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Sep 22, 2024"}, {"review": "Had a wonderful time with my friends at the filming of the tonight show.

The ticket said not to arrive until 3:15 and if you did arrive earlier, you would be asked to leave. I got there around 3 and there was already a fairly long line, so that was annoying. If you're not going to enforce the 315, don't put that in the ticket. The started the checkin process before 315. The seating seems a little random. They load you by the letter or number you get on your ticket. I got WW, but the couple in front of me got 8 and the numbers were called after the letters. There was a VIP family who had a different checkin process, but they were seated behind me. All was good in the studio though. A couple got engaged in the audience before the show and Jimmy came out to congratulate them. Jimmy also came out and did audience Q&A while they were setting up for the musical guest. The taping itself was longer than an hour because they had setup and takedown for a game. We were done by 630. Very fun and I recommend it.

They'll send out tweets about when tickets will/are available. (I have my Twitter set up to send me notifications when they tweet, as it's only a few times a month.) You'll use 1iota (website) to registration. Buttttt even if you get in to register, that doesn't guarantee you tickets, so don't get too excited yet.

If you're planning a weekend trip to NYC, you likely won't be there for an episode.)If you go through that process, they'll notify you a couple weeks before if you got in! I didn't on my most recent attempt... but my friend did! (Note: there is also a standby option. I have tried this before without success, but it really just depends on the day and your spot in line.)They'll then send you details, times, etc. It's honestly a lot of hurry up and wait. You have to get there early, but then you'll stand in line for a bit, then be screened through security, then hang out in a room for awhile, then be let in, then wait until warm up, then warm up, then the show... then it's over! It is very well run; they do this every day. Just be patient, as you will have down time. If you go in ready for this, you'll be good.While the show doesn't air live, they overall film it like it does--minus when I went and there was a band... it took a bit longer to set up, so that \"commercial break\" was longer. Jimmy came into the audience to chit chat during that break. I even got to speak to him; it was his 999th episode of The Tonight Show!One thing worth noting is that phones can't come out during the show, so turn them off and stick them away. Also, sometimes they'll do audience games, so expect the unexpected. (We had no idea Jimmy was going to run in the audience; he picked a girl right in front of us.)Overall, it is fun!

The stairs leading to the basement are filthy and the ballpit for kids looks as though it hasn't been cleaned in ages. The claw machines are over-priced and seem to be a gimmick to grab kids and their parents' money. I love arcades and claw machines but this spot came across as just being interested in getting money while doing the most minimal for cleanliness and atmosphere. Downstairs is another section where you can eat. It also has claw machines and feels like someone slapped together decorations really quickly to make the place look nice. There was also someone shaving ice really loudly in the kitchen, which really killed the whole cuteness vibe. I was willing to look past the decor as long as the cake was good...WRONG! We ordered the Durian crepe cake and waited about 15 minutes for our order. When we finally got it, it was FROZEN AND STALE. It literally tasted like frozen cardboard and was one of the most disgusting things I've eaten. You could taste the ice as you chewed it. The cherry on top was that the Durian crepe cake later gave us both FOOD POISONING. Overall, this was such a disappointment and I will definitely not be returning.

It appears to be little more than a backroom afterthought of the American Museum of Natural History. When you enter, you may enter through some revolving doors that hide the name, Hayden Planetarium, from view. Turning to your right is a big row of electronic kiosks supposedly designed for ticket purchases though none of them are functional. Each is posted with a sign stating \"Please See Representative,\" leaving you with the question of what representative and where. Once you procure your ticket you're herded up a floor to some dark area to see a little hardly visible flat screen to hear some inaudible words of Neil DeGrasse Tyson, then herded onward into the big round globe of a planetarium. Pretty soon an overhead movie comes on. Unfortunately the chairs are designed for you to view forward, not up, so plan on possibly getting a good crick in your neck before it is over. The movie itself is pretty good but the nonsense of vibrating your seats for no apparent reason seems silly, unnecessary and overly gimmicky. Once you've seen the movie you can go out into the hallways which at best resembles little more than a second hand Lower East Side flea containing all kinds of souvenirs, t-shirts, children's books and the like. Or if you like you can bore (at least it was soooo boring to me) yourself looking around at a bunch of rock like exhibits or snap shot like pictures of space. To me, Hayden doesn't amount to much. It's more of an afterthought attachment than a well-defined standalone destination and way too gimmicky.", "rating": "3", "visited": "Feb 9, 2023"}, {"review": "My boyfriend and I went to the planetarium for a quick visit during a trip to NY. It was our first time going and as huge Neil deGrasse Tyson fans (and space fans in general!), we were super excited. We didn't get to see any shows, as it was a quick visit, but we still had an amazing experience. There was a lot to see, a lot to learn and wonder about. It was beautiful and interesting. The gift shop was the real fun, and that's one of the reasons I'm taking the time to write the review. I bought my boyfriend a gift and he got me one, we left like kids coming from a candy store, really excited. However, we get home (to Michigan) and find out that his gift was defective. Obviously we are too far for a direct exchange, so I emailed the museum explaining what happened. They responded pretty immediately asking what the product was and offered to replace it for free, no worries about sending back the defective item! I responded happily and I just got the product today, a few days later! Not only did they send the product, they also sent really beautiful post cards with it.

The employees were very nice and directed us the whole way to our seats. The show started a little after 7 and was pretty decent for a planetarium show.

But they talked too much and too fast and the tour contained way too much technical information.  For over an hour, the guide droned on about various buildings and businesses, and there was very little room for banter or questions.  I feel like these guides must be on a timeline and have a specific script they are supposed to stick to.  My companion asked why I didn't ask the guide to stop talking.  What was I supposed to do?  At the end, I really wondered if I should have just said, \"We appreciate you, but I only purchased the VIP pass for skip the line access, and also thought it would be more than just naming random buildings at high speed.\"My friend was blown away by the views, but it was dampened by the blabbering guide.  She was exhausted to the point I had to take her back to the hotel to take a nap.  Me personally, I prefer the Empire State Building.  Not as high up, but can't beat the 1920s decor, Art Deco fixtures, and the fanfare.Our tour was so early that we couldn't capitalize on the nicer restaurant (though the pickings were slim there too).  We didn't want to wait in line at the overpriced grab and go cafe.  We didn't want \"swag\" from the store.

As I was let in, I asked the clerk (who was of course, white) why this affluent looking white couple was able to keep their stroller inside, and she shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her responsibility to look after the other side. You would think that they would enforce the rules to every guest, but I guess some guests have more pull than others, and I'm guessing it's because these guests were blond haired and blue eyed.It was a very clear picture of white privilege, and it was absolutely shameful.

This felt like an honest misunderstanding, but then later, that same staffer yelled at me as I waited in line for the bathroom. The bathroom is near an \"employees only\" section. As I was waiting, I simply turned my head to look at some of the books in the section, which I should reiterate, I DID NOT ENTER. Yet this staffer was quick to raise his voice and remind me that it was \"employees only.\" I wasn't DOING anything.

There is plenty of space inside, and I have parked my stroller inside many times before, so I was unsure of why this was an issue. I asked the clerk (young thin girl with glasses) if I could just leave it in because my large diaper bag is very expensive and I have all my personal belongings in there. She told me I would have to bring it with me on the carousel. Imagine a mother with a one year old who doesn't walk yet, carrying a large diaper bag, a large coat, my child's coat, and my child, and having to wait in line to get on a 2 minute ride. While waiting, I look over, and I see a father with a stroller parked inside (no child in the stroller), watching his child from the side. Unbelievable. As I was let in, I asked the clerk (who was of course, white) why this affluent looking white couple was able to keep their stroller inside, and she shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her responsibility to look after the other side. You would think that they would enforce the rules to every guest, but I guess some guests have more pull than others, and I'm guessing it's because these guests were blond haired and blue eyed.It was a very clear picture of white privilege, and it was absolutely shameful. I left and of course my baby's coat had fallen while I was on the carousel trying to juggle 5 different things.

First of all the floor covering they use to cover up what seems like an old ice hockey rink is all wrong. In some places it's unstable and if you're not careful you can really hurt yourself and that's what happened to my daughter. She had the safety walker and all and still managed to hurt her ankle. She will be ok, she's young and it wasn't that bad. That's not the point the point is they make the adults sign this waiver where you are responsible for your own safety and on this waiver even suggested that if you don't have insurance you shouldn't skate. They are not taking any responsibility for anything. I did read that if you see anything odd it's your responsibility to make them aware. I made them aware about the area on the rink that someone could get hurt and they seem to already know about it but still continue to let people skate. No warning in that area! They even put up cones but not where it should have been. It's not cool at all to continue to take people's money knowing you have this problem. How about you warn us about that and then let us sign a waiver. After what happened my youngest daughter just gave up! She was over it. My brother said he didn't like the floor at all, and after about 30 to 45 mins of being there everyone was ready to go. Even though it was free to skate, it still can add up to be a bit pricey. It was $7 to rent skates, $11 for the walkers, .25 per locker and once you open it, that's it unless you have another quarter so don't forget anything once you put your items in.

It's because the city that I live at which is San Francisco Ca doesn't have a Koreatown!!!The one thing that... I really like most about Koreatown of New York City is the Korean restaurants and the Korean Book Store that sells a lot of K POP Girl Group items like A Pink, Black Pink, Girls Generation, Red Velvet,Twice and exc.. And for all of the young girls out who like K POP boy groups like BTS this Korean Book has it as well!!!

I saw it off Instagram many times and decided to go. There are 2 floors of rooms for the game and you can either purchase 1 round for $25 or 2 for $40. You can choose either room for your games or do 1 and 1. Upon getting there, I checked in for my reservation. The host told us to take the stairs to either room but 3 was empty and a big group just went up to 4. The third floor had a winter, ski lodge theme. It was quite cute. There was a model snowmobile, a giant polar bear statue, a ski lift, faux fire pit and many more lodge themed decor. There were 9 holes for this game and each one got a little more difficult as we went on. My group of 4 was the only group there until about hole 3 then another couple of 2 came. Since they were a smaller group, they moved faster. The score keeping is hands free, meaning there's a touch screen that you tap to keep your scores and it tracks you to the next course after the last person in your group goes so we couldn't let the people behind skip us. There are also cup holders at each spot to keep your drink safe. While we were playing one of yhe employees cane over and kept telling us what to do and how to play. it was annoying. Like let us play and talk amongst ourselves. When we finished that room we tried to go to the next room. It was a bit more crowded and we got online to check in for a slot. there were about 2 groups of people before us. Then suddenly a staff members tells my group of 4, we need to put these people before you because they paid (as in with a private party). That groups was at least 10 people. We paid too and I said that but the employee said they were there first.. which they were not. It was so obnoxious. The host told us to come back and not even wait on line since it would be about 15 mins. I asked the host if we could go to the rooftop bar and if someone could let us know when it's our turn. We went up to get food and more than half hour later, no one came to let us know. On the roof there was also another private party yet it was still open to the public to sit and eat. The party was taking over the whole area and even hovering over our space/table. I asked the server if she could have them shuffle down and she said no, \"because they paid.\" Like wtf were we doing. we were also paying. We never emerged up going to the second room because it was still packed. The whole situation with prioritizing giant groups over other customers was so obnoxious. The food was good but the staff was not helpful nor accommodating. If not for having a ticket for the room we couldn't get into, I probably wouldn't be back.

It tastefully combines two mini golf courses with food, cocktails, lounging, and a speakeasy experience. You can make reservations online. Since it's new, I was able to book same day and there were lots of times available, but I do think it will fill up quickly as word gets out. You can book tickets for one or both of the mini golf courses. When we arrived in the lobby, waiters were serving passed hors d'oeuvres. This was unexpectedly fancy, but a nice touch to set the ambiance. They have a free coat check at the front desk as well. After you are checked in, you can visit any of the floors of the venue at your leisure. We started on the rooftop, which was spacious and had nice views of the Highline and Hudson. They had space heaters blasting which made many of the hightop tables a little too toasty, but there were also seats available away from the heaters for enjoying the open air. They also had a few swinging pod couches, which were fun to try out. For my first drink, I got the margarita standoff. It had way too much ice and was bitter and watery. My partner got the last diner, which was sweet and tasty so I ordered that next. To eat, I had the tofu tacos. They also had impossible beef tacos, so it was great to have some variety as a vegetarian. I enjoyed the tacos and the ingredients tasted fresh, but they could've used a sauce. My partner got the double smash burger and fries and loved both. After we ate, we headed to the mini golf courses located on the second and third floors. They had ski lodge and art museum themes. The museum course was a bit more spread out. Both courses had 9 holes. For both, you had to wait a few minutes for the party in front of you to finish each hole. The museum course also had around a 20 minute wait just to enter. On the courses, you could order drinks, but no food was allowed. Both were fun and had creative trick shots. You had to count your strokes, but there was a convenient digital screen at each hole for keeping score. Later in the night, it got pretty crowded, but the layout kept traffic moving pretty well. We finished the night in the speakeasy in the basement. It was not super crowded and had velvet couches, tables, and a nice hip hop playlist. Here I ordered the banana stand cocktail. It was sweet and very strong. The banana taste was not overpowering. Overall, this is a great option for date night or a group of friends.

We tried several cocktails from each menu:Margarita Standoff: a well-made spicy pineapple margaritas Ek Choug's Bounty (museum menu): similar to a tequila Aperol spritz Iced Irish Coffee (lodge menu): a delicious ski-lodge whiskey based dessert drinkFloat Like a Butterly: similar to a tequila apricot martini All of their cocktails were delicious - boozy, yet balanced and not too sweet. We chatted with the rooftop bartender and he expresses there is a very strong focus on cocktails overall. The golf was very fun also: There are two courses with different themes, ski lodge and museum, each with 9 holes.  Each hole had a medium level of difficulty and was very well thought out and creative. Scorekeeping was via tablet at each hole, and very easy to log after each person completed putting.

Once you enter the room where the show takes place, you sit first come first serve style. The seats are a little uncomfortable, because they are hard and have no back support. The ambiance is very cool , I loved it. As you wait for the show to start, the actors walk around making jokes and small talk and servers are walking around taking your order. Now , before the show begins, the actors auction off two throne seats in the front, with the seats you get a bottle of Mo\u00ebt and some caviar. Now I legitimately believed the auction was a joke because they made a lot of jokes during the auction. They made references like $400.00 to touch my ass and other things that could only be taken as jokes, but in reality, you have to pay this money. Of course, I didn't believe that if I pay $400.00, that I would be able to touch the actress ass, so naturally ,I thought it was a joke and all in good fun.  Before they escorted us to the throne, I said wait this can't be real and one of the actors said don't worry it's nothing, it's all ok. So I really believed we didn't have to pay this $400.00, but at the end of the show , they really brought a bill for $400.00 and I had to pay. I do understand that these actors are working hard and deserve all the earnings they make but I think they should make it crystal clear that the auction is real and not a joke  and you will have to pay this money. I just think the way they do this auction, is misleading and lacks integrity, just be up front so nobody feels tricked. As for the show, the show is incredibly entertaining and fun and funny. The actors are really fantastic and deserve all the accolades. They are funny and witty. Just great, they are just all around fantastic. I would recommend this experience, you will definitely enjoy the show. Remember it can be a little raunchy but it's all in good fun. The only negatives would be the uncomfortable seats and know the auction is real, you will pay , if you bid on it or have any reaction during the auction. Again, the actors , each and everyone of them are incredible and amazing. Great show", "rating": "5", "visited": "Jun 30, 2024"}, {"review": "Such a fun date night or a friends hang out.

It seems a little surreal that this used to be a real station (Court St) and now it's a showcase for the history of mass transit in NYC.  It's authentic from the street entrance, down the stairs onto the mezzanine level and all the way down to the platform level with the signature porcelain tiled walls, giant I-beam support columns and subway tracks.  There's even an old styled token booth that now serves as the ticket booth.The exhibits start with the early history of construction of the transit system in the 1800's when electric trolley street cars ran at street level and trains ran on tracks elevated above the street.  At the turn of the century, the underground subway system first opened and most above ground structures were soon eliminated and later buses would run on the streets in place of the trolley system.  The above ground trains still run in the outer boroughs transitioning from the tunnels crossing the East & Harlem Rivers and the history of digging of those tunnels are an interesting read.  I really enjoyed learning about the pre-MetroCard history of the subway token and the exhibit of old turnstiles, many of which I still remember in service when I was a kid.There's something about trains that kids really enjoy and they bring out the kid in adults as well.  There are mockups of trains and buses that the kids can pretend to drive.  When you descend to the lower platform level, that's where the IRL stuff are located.  There are real examples of subway cars from the last 120 years and it's real kick to see the ones from 1907 into the 60's & 70's.  You'll notice that almost all of them only had overhead fans for the comfort of their passengers during NYC's heat waves and air conditioned subway cars  & buses didn't start showing up until the 70's.  The vintage subway cars here are working examples and they do take them out into the tunnels on special occasions.  There are safety rails installed between cars and tracks, but just be careful of your kids running and there are a lot of kids running around.I just love this piece of NYC history and hope to return and maybe ride on a 1907 subway car for real rumbling down the tunnels like a century ago.

I've been twice now (including with family) and feel like I takeaway so much from each visit. Both times were on the weekend, and the museum is really decently busy. If you think you'd enjoy it with less people, maybe go during the weekday. I was a bit worried about it engaging everyone, but my family loved it. The museum itself is actually an old subway station, and you down like any subway to get inside. Tickets are EXTREMELY affordable at $10 per person. An extremely underrated part of this museum are the ads that they show in the old subway cars. It is such a fascinating peak into history and consumerism, even brand evolution! Some of my other favorite parts of the subway include the collection of subway poems, the antique subway cars that you can walk and sit inside (of course), and well as the exhibit on reefing red birds. You could easily spend 2-3 hours here and still want to come back. My one small gripe is that the bathrooms can be pretty gross.

But until recently, that list did not include the New York Transit Museum. I'm not sure why it took me so long to check out, but as I was leaving, my only regret was that I hadn't visited earlier.One of the coolest things about this museum is that it's underground, housed in what was formerly a subway station from 1936. As you walk through the exhibits, especially those detailing the arduous process of creating the tunnels, part of you feels as though you are there with the workers. It's a history lesson that leaves a lasting impression - every time I take the subway now, I notice something that reminds me of what I learned here.The highlight, of course, is the collection of preserved subway cars from different eras. I've seen these a couple of times during the holiday nostalgia rides, when vintage train cars are temporarily added to the regular subway service. Walking through them in the museum is a different experience, however; there are significantly fewer people, offering a chance to observe the nuances in city transit over the years and the evolution to the present day.Everyone should visit the New York Transit Museum at least once.

Knocked off a star for a couple of minor issues This place has two different experiences you can book for \"beating the bomb\". You can end with a foam blast or a paint blast. How it works is that when you arrive, the staff check you in and give you plastic type overalls to wear. These go over your clothes but it was quite warm so we wore these around our waists until the final room. In each of a series of rooms, your team has to complete missions to earn bomb defusing time at the end room. All of the missions were fun, unique, and required team work. If you did well in a certain room you could advance to higher difficulties of levels. In every room, you need to activate it was a wristband. In some of the rooms, you needed the wristbands to play. However, often times there was a delay in the wristband reacting to the receiver and especially in one room, caused us to not do as well as we could have. Despite that, my group had a blast and were excited to get to the end. We actually had so much time banked that \"winning\" in the last room was not difficult. Luckily, they still let us experience the bomb. I will say that the paint colors are not as vibrant as they seem in online pictures which, while minor, was kind of a small let down. What was cool was that in the end, you get a breakdown of how you did overall and in each room. They also send you pictures and videos of the final room.

For the experience, I think the pricing is very fair. When you make a reservation, the person who makes it puts down $10. I thought that was the table fee, but that just got deducted from my piece. Thus, you only pay for what you make! Yes, I agree that $25 for a small plate is high, but for something that you are painting yourself with a variety of paints and supplies available to you, I think that's justified.The staff at The Painted Pot was extremely welcoming and friendly. They answered all questions and explained everything clearly. A different set of staff members helped me out at pickup (5 days later) and they were equally enthusiastic. My friend and I booked a reservation for 12:30-2. In the beginning, it was peaceful, but toward the end, there were many kids. If you want a zen experience, definitely book earlier on a weekday. The space is small, so it also can get cramped. If you are doing anything elaborate, 1.5 hours will probably not be enough for you to do 3 coats of paint, so you will probably need to book for a longer period of time.

The drinks are fun and cool and very good. The prices are regular NYC prices , so can be expensive but not too bad. Once you enter the room where the show takes place, you sit first come first serve style. The seats are a little uncomfortable, because they are hard and have no back support. The ambiance is very cool , I loved it. As you wait for the show to start, the actors walk around making jokes and small talk and servers are walking around taking your order. Now , before the show begins, the actors auction off two throne seats in the front, with the seats you get a bottle of Mo\u00ebt and some caviar. Now I legitimately believed the auction was a joke because they made a lot of jokes during the auction. They made references like $400.00 to touch my ass and other things that could only be taken as jokes, but in reality, you have to pay this money. Of course, I didn't believe that if I pay $400.00, that I would be able to touch the actress ass, so naturally ,I thought it was a joke and all in good fun.  Before they escorted us to the throne, I said wait this can't be real and one of the actors said don't worry it's nothing, it's all ok. So I really believed we didn't have to pay this $400.00, but at the end of the show , they really brought a bill for $400.00 and I had to pay. I do understand that these actors are working hard and deserve all the earnings they make but I think they should make it crystal clear that the auction is real and not a joke  and you will have to pay this money. I just think the way they do this auction, is misleading and lacks integrity, just be up front so nobody feels tricked. As for the show, the show is incredibly entertaining and fun and funny. The actors are really fantastic and deserve all the accolades. They are funny and witty. Just great, they are just all around fantastic. I would recommend this experience, you will definitely enjoy the show. Remember it can be a little raunchy but it's all in good fun.

It seems a little surreal that this used to be a real station (Court St) and now it's a showcase for the history of mass transit in NYC.  It's authentic from the street entrance, down the stairs onto the mezzanine level and all the way down to the platform level with the signature porcelain tiled walls, giant I-beam support columns and subway tracks.  There's even an old styled token booth that now serves as the ticket booth.The exhibits start with the early history of construction of the transit system in the 1800's when electric trolley street cars ran at street level and trains ran on tracks elevated above the street.  At the turn of the century, the underground subway system first opened and most above ground structures were soon eliminated and later buses would run on the streets in place of the trolley system.  The above ground trains still run in the outer boroughs transitioning from the tunnels crossing the East & Harlem Rivers and the history of digging of those tunnels are an interesting read.  I really enjoyed learning about the pre-MetroCard history of the subway token and the exhibit of old turnstiles, many of which I still remember in service when I was a kid.There's something about trains that kids really enjoy and they bring out the kid in adults as well.  There are mockups of trains and buses that the kids can pretend to drive.  When you descend to the lower platform level, that's where the IRL stuff are located.  There are real examples of subway cars from the last 120 years and it's real kick to see the ones from 1907 into the 60's & 70's.  You'll notice that almost all of them only had overhead fans for the comfort of their passengers during NYC's heat waves and air conditioned subway cars  & buses didn't start showing up until the 70's.  The vintage subway cars here are working examples and they do take them out into the tunnels on special occasions.  There are safety rails installed between cars and tracks, but just be careful of your kids running and there are a lot of kids running around.I just love this piece of NYC history and hope to return and maybe ride on a 1907 subway car for real rumbling down the tunnels like a century ago.

It's a history lesson that leaves a lasting impression - every time I take the subway now, I notice something that reminds me of what I learned here.The highlight, of course, is the collection of preserved subway cars from different eras. I've seen these a couple of times during the holiday nostalgia rides, when vintage train cars are temporarily added to the regular subway service. Walking through them in the museum is a different experience, however; there are significantly fewer people, offering a chance to observe the nuances in city transit over the years and the evolution to the present day.Everyone should visit the New York Transit Museum at least once. I learned a ton during my visit, while also gaining another perspective on what it means to be a New Yorker.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Apr 25, 2024"}, {"review": "Sometimes being a tourist in your own backyard pays off. In this case, making the trek to BK to check out this museum was well worth the $10 ticket and travel time. Its a true hidden gem. So much so, that you enter on the corner via an older subway stop. give yourself a solid 90 mins to truly explore. dont forget to head downstairs to check out about 20 older train cars that range from 1904 to modern times. this was my favorite part because you can see the transition in subway cars and learn about them.the museum is kid and adult friendly, very clean (surprise surprise for a subway stop), a bit interactive, and organized.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Dec 1, 2023"}], "reviews_count": "460"}

I went into the Gap to browse for close for my daughter, but was Informed they didn't match the online price, so I left empty handed. All and all, I left this place very disappointed.

There is even a large fountain with a giant Christmas tree decoration at the center with several more decorations in surrounding (pictures attached). In this outlet, there are 4 levels/floors containing restaurants (Wasabi Japanese steakhouse, Nori Sushi Shop, Clinton Hall), bubble tea/dessert shops (Bake Culture, Kung Fu Tea, H\u00e4agen Dazs), fast food shops (Shake Shack, Starbucks), and many clothing stores (Nike Factory Shop, Guess, Levi's, Columbia, Banana Republic, etc.).I have visited a few of the clothing stores, and have gotten bubble tea from Bake Culture several times and I was very impressed. You can also see a view of Manhattan skyline. Besides all of this, there is also lots of music playing all day from the venue's speakers/radio.Next time, I hope to buy some pastries from Bake Culture, try out the Wasabi steakhouse, and buy some Kung Fu Tea!I am giving this a 4 out of 5 stars because there is definitely some room to improve (in terms of variety). There are so many clothing shops (at least 10), but not as many places to dine in comparison (opening a Japanese steakhouse, Sushi spot, and Clinton Hall for craft beers and burgers is an awesome start, however).

We loved our experience together but not so much with the customer service. The rest of the staff seem nice and responsive, but there is 1 person in particular who is cold and seems to give an attitude with everything. I'm inquisitive by nature and so by default, I like to ask questions. My group was interested in purchasing clay to bring home and using their kiln to fire, and coming back to glaze. I had questions like: how much clay comes with it, how much do we need to pay, how many kiln firings, what type of clay is this, do you have other options, etc. I wanted to learn about the process because I am interested in ceramics as a hobby. I was often interrupted and met with quick, annoyed answers and the coworker on the side helped summarize his answers in a way that was more friendly. They don't have patience for people who want to learn more or learn about the process. Business here is very transactional. If you are here to just paint a piece and go, you'll be fine. I was here on the terms of hoping to be a repeat customer with purchasing clay and returning regularly for handbuilding, and I was glad I got to ask questions to suss out how the relationship with the business would be. NYC ceramicists will know that it is incredibly difficult and competitive to register for classes. I wanted to do handbuilding during my \"wait time\" as I search for a studio, but decided not to based on my interactions with the staff. I'm happy to say that I am now a part of another studio where they encourage questions, learning, and growth. Painted Pot unfortunately does not value those attributes.--- It hurts me to write negative reviews especially for small businesses, so let me also leave a few positive notes that I did enjoy: * Majority of the staff are kind, helpful, and responsive (with the exception of the 1 person) * The staff here are diverse and LGTBQIA+ friendly - I love to see representation and community in a team!! * They're not too strict on the reserved times* Lots of options for glaze & pieces to paint", "rating": "5", "visited": "Nov 25, 2024"}, {"review": "My friend had mentioned wanting to try painting pottery, so when we randomly walked by The Painted Pot, I made a mental note to check out their pricing. For the experience, I think the pricing is very fair. When you make a reservation, the person who makes it puts down $10. I thought that was the table fee, but that just got deducted from my piece. Thus, you only pay for what you make! Yes, I agree that $25 for a small plate is high, but for something that you are painting yourself with a variety of paints and supplies available to you, I think that's justified.The staff at The Painted Pot was extremely welcoming and friendly. They answered all questions and explained everything clearly. A different set of staff members helped me out at pickup (5 days later) and they were equally enthusiastic. My friend and I booked a reservation for 12:30-2. In the beginning, it was peaceful, but toward the end, there were many kids. If you want a zen experience, definitely book earlier on a weekday. The space is small, so it also can get cramped. If you are doing anything elaborate, 1.5 hours will probably not be enough for you to do 3 coats of paint, so you will probably need to book for a longer period of time.

The games are paid for by tokens. They have token machines in the corner which costs .25 cents for one token (not bad!). They have nice selection of retro games to choose from. Some of the games ate a few tokens before working, but it is to be expected on those games. They have little tables near all the games so you can place your drinks down right next to you while playing which is great. Not the most incredible bar in the planet, but definitely a fun way to kill some time and have fun transporting back to older times.

Wished there was more space between the aisles as it was rough to move around people They do a security check on entry and don't allow any outside food/drinks so they make you leave it all up front. There not many tables or space by the games to put the food/drinks you order inside either so you'll spend most of your time shuffling your drink around while you play unless you get the little table space by each game.

There were tons of rides and games, no idea how much it was to play, but the prizes seemed fun; lots of giant stuffed animals of every type. It smelled so good walking around that my stomach begged me to try some food. After walking through the whole fair to get an overview of the options, I set my heart (and stomach) on the arancini vendor. It was 2 for $8 or 3 for $10, so my boyfriend and I split the 3 arancini deal. We got pesto, broccoli rabe and sausage and peppers.

There's no fights or anything like what goes on at the McCaren Park pool. There are a lot of very local and long time Brooklyn natives here.

I think the class had about 7 participants total, with two teachers.I came in from Manhattan, and took the PATH to get back home. The walk from the station to Pier 13 isn't short, so I can see why Google Maps suggests the bus to get to Pier 13. Personally I plan to snag a ride share from the station to Pier 13 in the future since I run late to most things and the walk took a while. Although I've been paddle boarding before, this class highlighted that I had never been taught some paddle boarding basics during my prior adventures.We hung out pretty close to the docks most of the time because the water was so choppy that day, but I believe the instructors said under better conditions the class sometimes ventured further out. For those of you wondering about how clean the water is - I personally did not mind falling in and was splashing my hair with the water to cool down as needed. The water felt fairly clean, and was \"brackish,\" as the instructors liked to say. The instructors for this class were great, namely Ben (I believe that was his name anyway). He was fun, easy to talk to, and 100% willing to jump into the water to demonstrate re-mounting the board for people that had fallen. They cover how to get onto your board from the dock, how to hold your paddle, which parts of your body you should be engaging to paddle, paddling while kneeling, paddling while standing, tips on steadying yourself, and re-mounting the board. By the end of the hour I felt way more confident, and was interested in signing up for their other classes where you get a guided tour of the nearby areas.

Keep in mind, I've kept plenty of fish and my water parameters and temperature are perfect in every tank.1. Every single loach I've purchased ended up giving me ich even in quarantine. I've purchased loaches separate online and those didn't have ich at all.2. I bought a Green Terror that consistently got sick with mysterious illnesses and required care almost every other week from some issue. It eventually died bleeding to death.3. Severum I bought came with a busted fin that they told me would heal but it never did for some reason.4. The black ghost knife fish ended up dying within days with no explanation despite being seemingly healthy and ate at night.5. They bagged one of my loaches in a single bag and didn't check for leaks. The bag was dripping slowly and emptying itself and I had to rush back to the store while the loach nearly died.6. Bought a group of shrimp and 2 randomly died a day later and they wouldn't even credit me or replace them.7. Bought 3 trapdoor snails, they didn't move for days and all 3 died fouling my tank. I had to do a water change. It ended up shocking my mystery snails who were perfectly fine before the trapdoors were introduced.8. Bought a generic sponge filter from them only to find out the interior plastic was cracked due to being poorly made.9. Bought a school of 20 Neon Tetras and 3 months later, only 9 survived while 11 died of unknown causes. Not a good batch.10. They sold me a single fish from a small tank where they have misc. community fish in. The worker told me it's a peaceful community fish and is good with inverts. About 2 weeks in, this fish has killed at least 10 shrimps, nipped antennas of my snails, and I discover it's moderately aggressive and needed a school of at least 6.I've supported this business over and over again trying to give them chances because I rather support them than Petco, but this is becoming very stressful, and a lot wasted effort and money.

Dress up, dress down, either way you'll fit right in. Wasn't too busy for a Sunday night but I do recommend a reservation because they space the couches and tables out very nicely for an intimate space between you and your guest. The servers and bartenders there are wearing corsets and robes which totally looked appropriate and turns out they actually do sell their own corsets as well! To celebrate women's month they have crazy deals all March long, very appreciated!  The owners ( Joey and Deborah) are actually so suited for this business because they completely make you feel comfortable and almost as if we were being welcomed into their home. So thankful for having us come in and so excited to tell us all about their establishment! We even received a free \"vaccine\" shot from a syringe filled with everything from honey to vitamin C and tasted delicious to help out with immunities, what a cool idea during this crazy time. Drinks are strong yet delicious and our brownie with nougat topping was freshly made and delicious. Food menu is all freshly handmade and had a lot of healthy options which is pretty rare to find.

Luckily for me, I got there early enough on all 3 days to avoid the crazy long lines. Some of my friends took an hour when they came later.The venue was the perfect size and they even had a stage inside MetLife Stadium, which was really awesome, especially after the recent Super Bowl win for the Giants (though they didn't play here, it was still cool to be on Giants territory).All of the stages were far enough to not have much interference from neighboring stages, which was good.

I ordered several $7 beers and 2 frozen margaritas (in those fun big tall cups!), but no food. However, there was a very big selection of cuisines to choose from. The sound was pretty amazing as well. It was a little too loud in the front of the stages, but that's sort of  given. I won't really comment on the DJ's performances as that's more of a preference thing than a review for the festival.The best thing about this carnival is that they have lockers for rent. My friend and I split the $70 3-day rental and it was the best $35 I ever spent. I was able to stow away my sweater and other miscellaneous items during the festival so I could move freely. You're also allowed to keep things in the locker overnight if you get the 3-day rental, which was perfect for the eye drops I was forced to buy at the general store, since they didn't allow us to bring any in.A semi-little known fact (I say semi because the lines were still pretty long) was that there were bathrooms available for use in the stadium (2 separate womens bathrooms, to be exact). After I figured this out on the second day, I only used these bathrooms instead of the gross port-a-potty bathrooms. The stadium bathrooms were surprisingly clean. The lines were a little bit longer, but it was definitely worth the wait.The carnival attractions are pretty cool, too. They had a bunch of random exhibits and rides. The rides were pretty fun and a nice little rest from all of the dancing.Overall, this was a VERY fun experience for me and if they decide to have another EDC, I'm definitely in.", "rating": "5", "visited": "May 27, 2015"}, {"review": "Saturday, 5/24/2014* $150/ticket* $30 for parking* Over 2 hours waiting in line for the Will Call (tickets already pre-bought)* After obtaining tickets from Will Call, General Admission tells me that my ticket was already scanned (meaning someone used my ticket)* After haggling with General Admission and finally entering the event, it rains* It rained heavily, the music shut down for a decent amount of time, and thousands of people huddled into the stairs of MetLife stadium* Everyone tried to buy food -- that was a disaster", "rating": "4", "visited": "May 29, 2014"}, {"review": "Get to the Chase:Pros:1) AMAZING sets, (Armin killed it)2)  Great venue (Large enough to not feel unable to move, small enough to get to all the stages in a reasonable walking distance)3)  Flawless execution (no disruptions like what happened EDC Vegas 2012)4) Affordable (not daylight robbery prices like Sensation or Ultra)5) Plentiful water stationsCons:1) Drinks and Food were clearly exploited...1 gatorade $9, 1 hotdog $6+...thank goodness for free water2) Not allowed to keep the caps of purchased drinks...no idea why...

There is a transfer at Secaucus though where Police made my chug/dump my 4loko before getting on the second train to Metlife.Once you got there the line to get in is massive/chaotic/crazy.

ATB, Armin, Aviccii, Sebastian Ingrosso, Alesso, Calvin Harris, Erik Morillo, the guys from Swedish House Mafia - and more. And that was just Saturday's line up! Sometimes I found myself running between the four main stages because so many good people were playing at the same time!2) It's an ALL day event. I only bought a day pass (it ran Fri - Sun - i bought Saturday's since the lineup looked the best). It runs 12 - 11 PM and THE PARTY DON'T STOP (to quote Kesha, hehe).3) Full of fun, young people. I'm not sure I saw anyone much over 30 there and since you have to be 18 to get in - it's like 15,000 people running around during the summer who are all eligible, fun, and down to dance. 4) Easy to get to. I trekked out to Meadowlands via NJ Transit from Penn Station (as a true city girl - i was worried about it - but NJ Transit was CLEARLY expecting us). Just follow the people in neon if you get lost. They even stock piled trains getting out of the stadium so people could get home faster. +1 for NJ Transit!5) Awesome sound system, visual effects and special effects. They shot off at least 15 minutes of fireworks as Aviccii finished his last set. Each artist had cool background images and some had laser/light shows too. I was impressed for a stadium, especially since it's mostly outdoors. The Cons (not many)1) The line to get in took FOREVER. With Gen Admission passes, we waited well over an hour to get in. Then there was a separate line for them to check bags. There was ANOTHER line to get wristbands for booze. Too much waiting with little to no line organization. 2) There's almost nowhere if you need to sit in a shady spot. It's all outdoors and only one set was covered, so bring a hat or come a little later in the day. Know before you go: 1) Bring cash. It's a concert. Beers cost 10 bucks, waters are 5 bucks, and shirts cost 30+. There were a few ATMs but avoid the surcharge (and lines) since almost no vendors take credit there. 2) Buy VIP passes if you can. The entrance line was more than an hour long, even coming a couple hours late. VIP lets you take a faster line. You can also buy liquor in the VIP areas (only beer with the general admission passes). Lastly, and most importantly, there were 'real' bathrooms for people with VIP passes. The definition of GROSS is a Portapotty!!!3) People dress up. It's a sea of neon green, yellow, and pink. Plastic sunglasses, tutus, Gumby costumes, Harajuku girls -- it's all good. Seriously, no judgement. I was pretty conservative and wore capris and a bright tank, which was just fine too. 4) There were lockers available for rent if you don't want to carry your stuff. 5)  They were fairly strict about what you brought in.

You can always see a bunch of people playing Smash, MarioKart, or one of the various FPS in the main room having a great time.Personally, I'm a gamer, but playing in a public setting where I have to put myself together and pay to game is not my thing. That being said, BrookLAN is GREAT for people who don't have their own rig or consoles and/or want to hang out with a group of people they wouldn't be able to cram into their NY apartment. You can get a membership or just pay to play for the day. There's a huge room full of PCs, so you have somewhere to go with a reliable setup and internet connection when you need it. This is a fantastic idea for the community, especially since they have liquor, beer, wine, frozen drinks, and pretty good food.While we didn't game, we had a nice time eating lunch. We both got the beer and burger special ($17) and added fries (+$3). Non-New Yorkers beware, but $20 for a burger, fries, and a beer is a great deal. The burgers exceeded my expectations, honestly.

Thankfully the table was ready after about 15 minutes, but I was struggling to keep my phone in a place where I'd get signal. We sat down and ordered some food, and we asked specifically to bring the appetizers/small plates before the main. This didn't happen. They brought the burger and pizza before the other plates, and the waitress didn't even know (she came to ask us if we had received the other plates already). So we ended up having our mains before the starters. Not a big deal but we had specifically asked and this wasn't honored. Thankfully the food was very good! The table where we got sat was big enough to contain all the plates but we ended up being clumped up with the other tables, resulting in us having to walk under the table to be able to get out of our seats to use the restroom. Also we were under the music speaker so it was very loud. But this didn't kill the mood! The place is very cute with lots of pictures and art on the walls, dim lights and very good music.
