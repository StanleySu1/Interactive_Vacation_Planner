Heads up, ended up just ordering 2 drinks and leaving early for another spot so maybe could have given it another shot, but didn't think it would be worth it. Drink selection: If rum is your alcohol of choice and you're not really into tequila, whisky or gin you will likely feel limited in the options available.Service: staff seemed really helpful and will help you choose a drink if you ask, which wasn't a service we used because we had chosen far ahead of time. It's nice that they give you free water, especially because the drinks are strong. Taste: based on the interesting ingredients, we thought it would come together better. I was hoping for an experience where each ingredient on is own is ok/good, but absolutely amazing when combined. I was hoping for the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, which I didn't get here unfortunately. We've personally have had far better cocktails in many other places at lower price points with much better ambiances. Peanut old fashioned: smelled like peanuts, probably just from the peanut dust sprinkled on top of the ice cube. This made it very fragrant to drink. It smelled more like peanuts but tasted like a regular old fashioned. I would have liked personally a stronger orange fragrance in the drink. Nice clear ice.Between the red sheets: I thought it was as a bit strong at first but it mellowed out a bit more as you drank it. On top of the ice there was a hibiscus flower and strawberry powder, that gave it subtle fruity and floral fragrance. Personally, to us, it tasted like hibiscus tea (but also, not great hibiscus tea) with some alcohol in it. To be fair, I really like hibiscus tea.  Ambiance: a speakeasy to me evokes dark, intimate and private seating. My favorite speakeasies have this. With Red Frog, though, you are really close to other people and the music is quite loud. It was nice the entrance was tucked away from both Monkey Mash (the bar next door, so patrons of Monkey Mash will likely walk past the entrance without noticing Red Frog is even there). Monkey Mash and Red Frog seem to share an entrance, and in our case, there was a person guiding you in depending on your establishment. Then, when you reached the hidden door to Red Frog, a little window opened and you could briefly see the bartender confirm your reservation with your guide.

It's not Versailles.Sometimes called the \"Versailles of Lisbon,\" the National Palace of Queluz was once the home of Portuguese royalty.  It is a large enough palace, but it's not anything on the scale of a castle such as Neuschwanstein.  It is also known as the pink palace, but it's a light shade of pink and the style is either Baroque or Rococo, although I don't really know the specifics of where one ends and the other begins.  Either way, elaborate ornamentation is the name of the game. When touring Queluz, one goes through in small groups.  However, one can stray a little to ponder something a little longer or take a photograph.  Photographs are allowed as long as the flash is disabled. By wandering too far, a security guard will nudge you back to where you should be, as would any herding dog worth their salt.  That said, the employees are all nice people and very informative.  They know the history of Queluz backwards and forwards.While the exterior of the palace is attractive, the craftsmanship inside is stunning.  I find it to be one of Lisbon's most beautiful attractions and most definitely worth repeat visits.  In addition to the grandeur of the palace, the gardens of Queluz are also very detailed and worth strolling through, both for their beauty and tranquility.Getting here is easy.  If driving, an off-ramp from one of the ring roads, either the CRIL or the CREL, exits practically in front of the palace.  If taking the train, one takes the Sintra bound train from Lisbon-Rossio and exits at Queluz Belas.  From there, it's an easy 20 minute walk south to the palace.  There is even a McDonald's at about the halfway point, at which I once treated myself to the Big Mac combo meal.Three things to note:- the palace has 1 or 2 days of the week where it is closed; check ahead so you won't be disappointed- the Lisboa Card may provide a small discount from the nominal entry fee, but verify that as well- I like Queluz way better than the hilltop castle at Sintra because it is less \"over the top,\" less expensive, less cordoned off, and more \"friendly\" to photographers", "rating": "4", "visited": "Jan 18, 2014"}], "reviews_count": "8"}

Many of the stores I'm sure will be interesting to the local Portuguese population though, with more familiar brands for me being elsewhere in the city. For food and drink, you can find Burger King amongst other smaller brands.The toilets aren't free, while I understand public toilets for free is less common around Europe, you shouldn't have to pay to pee, especially when you're spending money and shopping anyway.For shopping in Lisbon, I much prefer Colombo which is larger and has a better selection of places to eat and drink, but this isn't a bad alternative if you're looking for a change, something a bit more modern, or close to the Airport. 3*", "rating": "3", "visited": "Jan 13, 2024"}, {"review": "It's a mall.I always like going to other countries and checking out how locals live, especially grocery stores, because I want to see how they eat and keep a household. Malls too, can be interesting, but our world is so globalized now, it's hard to find anything culturally different in a mall. What is neat, though, is to see how products vary from nation to nation. Gap in London does not have the same line as it does in the US. Lacoste and Adidas in France are totally different from how they are stateside. Etc. So for that, the place was interesting. And, they did have some Euro brand stores not available in the US, which are fun to find.There was a popular craft beer kiosk near the main entrance, as well as other typical kiosks throughout the main skylight-ed concourse.This mall is in the Parque de las Naciones district, a district that is more for locals than tourists with redevelopment toward highrises of offices and apartments. Thus, the mall is very popular with Lisbonites, but of course tourists still find their way here and are plenty welcome.Bathrooms are clean and newly designed.The train/metro/bus hub station, Esta\u00e7\u00e3o do Oriente, is across the street, so this is very easy to get to, from any part of the city and beyond.If you need something from the mall while in Lisbon, I recommend this place, but if you are in Lisbon from abroad, like we were, I recommend getting in and out quickly, so you can go take in the loads of old culture this beautiful city has to offer!", "rating": "4", "visited": "Mar 26, 2018"}, {"review": "Large and modern shopping mall just across the street from the Oriente metro/train station, which you can also reach underground.

I fell in love with Lisbon and I know that Tours by Jorge made this happen. The history and beauty of Portugal is again, absolutely amazing. I know for sure that I would not have been able to truly experience Lisbon via a hop-on hop-off sightseeing tour bus. Jorge took us to some of the hidden gems of this beautiful country.

In part because of the ringing endorsements from family and friends, and also because I was travelling there to celebrate my 40th birthday with my husband and three very close girlfriends. Our trip far exceeded my expectations in large part due to our two-day tour with Jorge . Leading up to the trip, my husband had connected with Jorge after researching tours on Yelp. After providing very little direction - only that we had an interest in visiting Obidos and tasting Portuguese wine - Jorge crafted a two-day itinerary that perfectly aligned with our tastes. On the first day we travelled to Evora and Monsaraz, two medieval villages rich with history, food, and wine. On the second day, we visited Quinta do Sanguinhal (a fantastic family-owned winery), Nazare, and Obidos. In the van ride between destinations, Jorge provided a brief overview of the history of Portugal interspersed with entertaining anecdotes to bring the history alive. At each stop, Jorge provided us with the perfect balance of guided tour and free time. Jorge also arranged delicious lunches each day at local restaurants that featured the best of Portuguese cuisine. At Evora, we enjoyed exploring an ancient Roman ruin, old cathedral, and unique chapel. At Monsaraz, we marveled at the spectacular views, enjoyed a great lunch at a quaint restaurant, and tasted some of the local wine. Quinta do Sanguinhal on the second day was a special treat and Jorge arranged a tour of the property that ended with a wine tasting.Throughout both days, Jorge was a fantastic host and guide.

Now at this point the bartender had no idea of my tastes other than my description so a pretty good start  Over the course of the next two evenings we worked from riffs in Bourbon witha Banana end note, sazarac with Japanese whisky, to Martini with Absinthe and bitters, Naked and Famous, Last Word, Garibaldi, Morning-glory Fizz... Each fantastic in its own right, with Leandro consistently demonstrating his amazing skills in looking after my drinks.

Back to the pasteis de Nata - trust me when I tell you that there is a difference in taste and quality. We tasted 4 of them in the same day - this one and the one at Cafe Tofa were the best. Warm, light, flaky, buttery crust and a warm, sumptuous, velvety, eggy custard in the center. You may not have the same restaurants or all the same foods on your tour but I feel certain that you will enjoy it. I highly recommend it as a wonderful way to see Lisbon, learn about the city, and gain an appreciation for the culture and food traditions of the city and country.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Apr 5, 2022"}, {"review": "We finished this tour earlier this evening and it was incredible!!

Had the pleasure of enjoying a few hours here in April 2022. Portugal being famous for their decorative ceramic tiles, this museum displays an extensive collection of both classical ceramic wall tile and modern art, housed in a 16th century monastery building. From the outside the building doesn't look super impressive though inside there's a good amount to see. Ticket price last I checked was \u20ac8, we arrived shortly after 10am on a Saturday and there was a line of about 20 people at the entrance and ticket counter though the line moved quickly. Upon entry first stop was the cafe for a quick breakfast, they took about 20ish minutes to open after the museum building opened, as we waited the staff was setting out chairs and readying some foodstuffs. Not wanting to wait too long, I went with a pastel de nata, a mini croissant and an espresso. The pastries were nothing special though not inedible. The espresso was solid. That being said, I came for the tiles and not the food, so getting to that...The exhibits start from the ground floor encircling a small courtyard and you make your way up a few more stories. The first two levels have more traditional tiles used for building ornamentation, some purely decorative motifs, others with elaborate scenes painted on them. The exhibit progresses in chronological order with upper floors featuring modern art. Since the museum sits in a historic monastery, the chapel, antechamber, auditorium and surrounding rooms part of the original church floor plan showcase elaborate wall and ceiling ceramic embellishments. Really gorgeous! Overall certainly recommend checking out this museum--there was a fair variety and what stood out to me was both the functionality and humor of some of the more classical pieces, and the creativity of the modern pieces.

Each room was more magnificent than the one before and the tiles are more unique, like nothing I've seen before.  We walked through tile chapels filled with religious tiles. We saw 20th century tiles that were art deco, art nouveau and even three dimensional. The hunting room was full of animal tiles. On the third floor we saw a panoramic view of London, the panels were 23 meters long and documented the history of Lisbon prior to the 1755 earthquake, breathtaking!There was an attractive restaurant and seating in a beautiful garden.

A few tables were taken but they were otherwise empty, with plenty of outside seating on top of the indoors area. And yes, they DO take reservations (young fella from NYC next to us had one). Perhaps both the quietness and the 'no reservations' are suspended during what's a low or shoulder season. The menu could be quite daunting. We picked out a few things to try, and the best were those giant shrimps, where you can ask the waiter (if they don't offer already) to take the meat off the shell - best way to eat it is to have the tail part combined with the creamy head with the tomali and juices. Not inexpensive, but well worth it. Everything was fresh and delicious, and cheap Portuguese wines (of good quality) was the icing on the cake.

There appeared too many in a small enclosure, and some looked like they had taken out their frustrations on one another.Dotted in between each area were plentiful toilets (which was convenient considering I had a stomach bug)and ice cream stalls. All of these were maintained at a regular basis and were well priced.We decided to hop on the monorail, which involved two people jumping on and a gent slamming a gate behind us.

My reasoning was that it would be the quickest way to see the historic character of the city in the time given. When I arrived at the subway station nearest Alta Villa, I saw a sign that pointed to Lisboa Story Center. That prompted me to look it up on-line and I found that it was advertised as an overview of Lisbon's history in one hour. I had time for that!!After walking around Old Town for a bit, I decided to hike down to the waterfront where the Story center was located. The entrance fee was \u20ac7 and was certainly worth it. Quite honestly, I thought it was ideal for kids. The multi-sensory approach was one that would have been geared toward older (late Elementary or Junior High) children as it featured a lot of props, illustrations, story-telling, etc. But it was also interesting for adults, even if it was a bit elementary.The audio guide that was included with the tour was indispensable as the narration was essential to the experience. However, the way it was set up was also a bit of an irritation because you had to be very careful where you stood. It was activated by the sensor nearest the device and you could be at the end of a display still taking in the last of that narrative, only to wander too far and abruptly pick up the narration for the next display.In general, the museum was set up well as it accomplished the intended purpose. It presented a quick overview of the highlights of the city's history. There was not much depth to the analysis but it did walk one through the timeline effectively. The one aspect that I enjoyed the most, and one where there was more substance to the display, involved the great 18th-century earthquake that changed Lisbon's character permanently. This was where it might have gotten a little intense for younger children. In general, if you want an overview of the history of the city, which is all I had time to accomplish on this visit, this place is a good option for that. It is worth the admission price if you know what you are getting. It probably took me a little more than an hour, but less than 90 minutes, to get through it.

While you listened to the longer chapters, there wasn't much to do instead of just hanging around looking at the same cheap boring printed reproductions of maps or interiors.Unfortunately I thought that the experience and interaction design was clumsy at some points: sometimes you weren't sure what to do, you accidentally triggered a new chapter, the visual and sound cues just weren't there. On the other hand, I thought that the video production was very good and the chapter about the 1755 earthquake was emotive and impressive in equal measure.

After paying 14 euros for our tickets, we entered the first room and found ourselves surrounded by six television screens that were all showing different things, with dizzying images moving quickly across each screen.

There were no markers on the floor, so if you accidentally took one step too far towards another screen, the audio switched to that text instead. If you wanted to hear the rest of the commentary from the first one, you had to start again from the beginning. After three minutes, I had a headache and a stomach ache, and my husband was not much better off. We decided to ask for a refund. There was no legitimate way out, so we jumped the gate and went back out the way we came in. The lady at the ticket counter felt our pain, but could not issue a refund. We had her ask her supervisor, to no avail. We had her ask her manager, who gave the final answer: no refunds. We decided that we didn't want to waste 14 euros, so we went through the \"story\" as quickly as possible, without looking at any television screens and without listening to that horrendously corny audio guide. There were a couple of nice things to look at, but no explanations that we could read. (Yes, I am going into the future kicking and screaming.) The best part was a film about the 1755 earthquake.

The cod fritters were fluffy and stuffed with an adequate amount of cod...arguably probably some of the best I've had throughout Portugal.   The lettuce salad was disappointing...it was a bibb lettuce drizzled with a very small dab of oil and would have been much better if it had some sort of vinaigrette or acid.  The fish soup, veal, linguini with clams were all executed well and very tasty.  Service was a little slow, but overall the dining experience was good.  And it's a good place for people watching. That's where the goodness ends...after dinner at the suggestion of the sommelier, we attempted to go to the bar downstairs for a drink, only to be told that we would have to wait in the outside queue for the bar patrons.

Well, first of all, they do have reduced admission rates (three euros) for children and over-65s, unlike what the previous Portuguese-language reviewer said (maybe its a new thing...)  When you go in you get (included in the admissions price), a sound device where you punch in numbers (corresponding to numbers on the wall) and listen to lectures on the aspect of fado shown in the particular exhibit.  Some of the lectures go on and on, and there's not always comfortable places to stop and listen.  But if one takes the time one can get a good overall picture of the genre.  The worst exhibit is the long photo of many fadisto/as, some of whom are numbered.  If you enter the number in your device you can hear a song by that singer.  But the whole display is in a relatively narrow aisle overlooking the lower floors.  You can lean on the railing and hope it doesn't give way if many people lean on it.  None of these people are named except in a diagram farther along and across the aisle.  In the diagram the people are also numbered, but not with the same numbers as in the photo.  So you'll need to back and forth to identify anyone, by comparing location and surroundings from the big photo.  In the next room are three seats with headphones and screens.  One of the three headsets was broken when I was there.  On the screens one can read a biography of each of many fado singers.  By pressing another button on the touchscreen one can hear a song.  But you can't read and listen at the same time.  Some of the singers have a set of photoes attached to their records, but once again, the photos can only be observed separately - one can't listen to music (or read) while the photos are being displayed.  There are many singers on the list - listening to a number of them gave me an idea of whom to check out further.  To listen to all though, would take half a  day.  I noticed that mostly people just check out the device and go on - it didn't look like many people listened to much of the lectures either.  Following this section was an exhibit of Portuguese guittaras and information about the development of the instrument and some of the luthiers who built them.  I'd like to know more about this instrument, and have a chance to try one out.  There are a few for sale in the museum's shop, but none of them were anything near being in tune.  They also had a couple very small stringed instruments for sale - the predecessor of the ukulele, I'd  guess.   And the shop has lots and lots of fado CDs for sale, and some sheet music.The museum is closed on Mondays and on a few holidays.  In spite of the less-than-optimal design of the museum, I'd say it's worth it to learn more about the genre of fado   And to listen to the various singers so you can find one you particularly like before making a purchase.", "rating": "3", "visited": "Nov 16, 2016"}], "reviews_count": "13"}

We stopped several times to get out and have him explain our surroundings. He offered to stop at any point if we needed to for any reason - restroom, beer/drink, sightsee, etc.. For the entire 4 hours he kept up his enthusiasm and amazed us with his knowledge of Lisbon and Portugal. I learned more from Reuben in that 4 hours than I ever learned in school about Portugals' history and how significant an impact it has played in World history. When it came time for us to head for our Pastei de Belem pastries, Reuben had the pass that let us go in immediately without waiting in the long queue outside. If you're even considering a quick tour of Lisbon, I can't recommend highly enough \"I Took A Tuk Tuk\" and specifically, Reuben Cordeiro.

What it lacks in a ready supply of disposable funding it more than compensates for in being gorgeous, diverse, lovingly maintained, & a welcome retreat from the bustle outside. The Norfolk Island pine standing some 75 feet tall was just one of many elegant miracles to be found here. I went twice during my stay, just to clear my head & commune with the space, breathe the air, & enjoy the beautiful living things around me.

There are signs saying what each plant or tree is, but there is no further information about them. There isn't much variation either, or if there is, it isn't apparent. The bed area up top was somewhat nondescript, though there is a fountain. The greenhouse had a special display of plants from the time of dinosaurs, but it wasn't set up to be particularly enthralling.Moving down the hill you come across more trees, a succulent garden, and what is supposed to be a couple of ponds. We were there in May and they were empty. The butterfly house was also closed. It's a nice green area, but the images that come to mind when I think of a botanical garden do not fit what is here, which is really just a glorified shady park-like area.Luckily the entrance fee of \u20ac2 per adult is not terrible, so see it if you want.

I came with my bf and I asked him for 1 ticket. He saw that we were together and he said \"4EU\", but I stated that I wanted to pay separately and he insisted that I pay for 2 tickets. Maybe he didn't want to press another button for the next transaction?I've been to my fair share of botanical gardens across North America (outside Toronto, California, Portland, etc.) and this one was probably the poorest of them all.It didn't look as though the grounds were maintained AT ALL. There were minimal signs and they were quite random - only a few signs in front of some trees stated the latin name. Nothing further.Also no organisation of the plants. It just seemed as though some tropical plants already existed and someone decided to fence it off and charge an entrance fee.\"Butterfly House\" was a fenced off shack with some moths. Place isn't that big, but we couldn't find the Conservatory, or whatever that separate building was called.

He recommeded a restaurant for our meal stop and made sure we were settled in at our table with a view before he left us to enjoy a seafood feast that he also recommended.

Nunu was patient, knowledgeable, and friendly.

A truly relaxing experience, the grounds were calm and peaceful, the walk was inclined but easy for a group of seasoned adults. The visit to the palace was vivid with color and informative.Next stop we visit the nearby town with ample time to catch lunch at one of many eateries and/or shop at the many stores. Be sure to get a Past\u00e9is de Nata before you depart!A scenic drive through the hills as you travel to the furthest western point in the European Continent, this stop with the green hills, crashing waves, and lighthouse was amazing!A final drive to the beach line you will enter Cascais where you will have time to explore the tourist beach haven or visit the free museum on its history. Whether you want a good drink or another Past\u00e9is de Nata you will enjoy the wind and the water in this town before ending back at you hotel or air BnB.A great trip to plan into you schedule and do ask for Nunu, he was the icing on the cake of this tour!", "rating": "5", "visited": "Mar 19, 2023"}, {"review": "Best Way to Tour these Sights!Our family of four was so very glad that we booked our day of touring with this group -- excellent all around!

Our guide Paulo was quite fun sharing local facts and fun stories along the way. Wifi was available on the van which was also convenient.Our fist stop was Cascais where we had time on our own for a gelato, visit a couple shops and have a beer overlooking the beach. Second stop was Cabo da Rocca. Very powerful landscape at this western-most point and only requires about half hour for some photos.Third stop was in Sintra where we had a few hours to get lunch and explore. We enjoyed a local bakalha restaurant and toured the Palace of Sintra in town.Last stop was Pena Palace which is stunning! A must see while in Lisbon. We toured thru the Palace at our own pace and met up with Paulo at the end. Our overall tour package proceeded in the opposite order of locations than is the norm; as Paulo explained, the destinations tend to be less busy doing this because \"everyone goes to the Pena Palace first\". His strategy seemed to be accurate as we didn't feel over crowded at any of them.
