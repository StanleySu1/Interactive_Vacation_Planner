Aside from all of that, this is a fun street to walk down to really get a true feel of the city. Many of Barcelona's iconic landmarks are located near or within a close proximity of Las Ramblas, so you're bound to walk through at some point while you're exploring. Because this is a busy area, most shops and restaurants tend to inflate their prices. Do some window shopping here and save your money for the places that are outside of Las Ramblas.

The reality is that you have to buy tickets to go inside any of Gaudi's masterworks. The difference is that La Sagrada Familia required making a reservation two weeks in advance, while Jamie W. and I bought the 41\u20ac tickets for Casa Batll\u00f3 about two hours before our desired time slot.Sure, they don't compare in scale or intent, but the vertical house built in 1904-1906 is quite remarkable with a flowing skeletal design and an arresting facade made up of colorful broken mosaic tiles (photo: https://yelp.to/0cKSYgVsrP). You'd think the building would stand out, but it's part of the Block of Discord, a series of four buildings built in the Modernista style of the same period.That's why this part of the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia was so crowded with tourists stuck on their Instagram app. Once we entered Casa Batlo, we were handed a tablet and earphones to take a self-guided tour. The highlights were the Atrium, which provides a constant source of light throughout the building's multiple floors (photo: https://yelp.to/JAiejV1ja3), and the Noble Floor with the mushroom-shaped fireplace and the swirling ceiling.The climax came at the rooftop terrace with the unique dragon back design and familiar Gaudi chimney stacks. It's not as dramatic as Casa Mila nearby, but there was a much needed bar serving a tasty glass of sangria (photo: https://yelp.to/46GRlYSmbf). After we made our way back down to the main floor, we were led to the basement where we had an immersive digital experience called Gaudi's Cube.Designed by Turkish-American digital artist Refik Anadol's, it was meant to be a deep-dive into Gaudi's mind. In other words, it had nothing to do with the architect himself, but it was very cool in a sweeping cacophony like Gaudi on molly, man (video: https://yelp.to/e73_YwRLv8).

I'm personally not a fan of self guided museum tours, and although this tour certainly gave me flashbacks, the modern approach to the practice is appreciated! Explanations and details are brief yet effective, and the tour takes you through multiple floors of the home, interior and exterior, attic and roof, in an organized flow that keeps everything interesting!

I found various aspects of the house quite cool, including the patio, office, and kitchen area. You get to see how Gaudi built the home for the owners. It's still crazy to know that there are current tenants living here that have been in the building for almost 70+ years.One of the coolest areas is going up to the attic. There you see some of the blueprints to the buildings but also the beautiful arches. You'll also see some of those hanging chains, which is a signature sight to see there.The best part to me is the rooftop where you see the sculptures of chimneys and a beautiful view of the city.At 28 EUR, it's not cheap. Some will think it's not impressive as Casa Batilo, I don't know because I didn't see it. However, this is definitely a bit less crowded and found the trip worthwhile.

The sinuous stone facade isn't structural at all, \"the curtain wall\" being something that only more modern buildings have adopted. The ornate free-form ironwork on the balconies reminded me of seaweed floating in the sea. It's a remarkable accomplishment to take a heavy material like iron and make it feel weightless. It's also extraordinarily sophisticated and beautiful.The attic and it's thin yet strong catenary arches (each one different from the next) requires computers to figure out today--yet he did it in his head (and using hanging chains, as you will see in the informative exhibit in the attic with 3D models that help you understand all his architecture). Admission is $35, including the audio guide which is well written and told from Gaudi's perspective. All proceeds from the tour go to a non-profit foundation for youth programs, so your money is going to a good cause.It's also well-run (unlike Casa Batllo which is a greedy nightmare). Not too many people are allowed in at once so you can really appreciate the building.And the rooftop, where Gaudi's whimsical sculptures of chimneys and vents make it look like an enchanted forest.

Barcelona has so many beautiful parks, and La Ciutadella is definitely one of them. This was personally my favorite smaller park to visit. And by \"smaller\" I don't mean small. This park is actually pretty dang huge, but there are so many grand parks by comparison. Parc de la Ciutadella is an excellent park to explore during your time in Barcelona. The park features Cascada Monumental (a beautiful cascade fountain), a large pond fountain, walking trails, a small lake, gardens, and several sculptures. The park also shares a space with the Barcelona City Zoo.When you enter the park, you'll be enamored by how lush and green it is. This was one of Barcelona's first ever green spaces and I can totally understand why. The gardens are absolutely stunning and the park holds some of the city's most old trees and foliage. Cascada Monumental and the pond fountain are both gorgeous. This fountain was actually one of Gaud\u00ed's earliest works and not many people are aware of this. The Roman Gazebo is super charming. You can walk up the steps, stand underneath it, and simply admire its' beauty. You can also look down at the pond fountain and the rest of the park from it as well. The views are amazing from inside the gazebo! There are several walking paths that are used by walkers, runners, and bikers alike. Many people like to enjoy the paths to take a leisurely stroll as they admire the park. There are so many neat sculptures too! I feel like this park could be considered an outdoor museum as there's lots to see from an art perspective. There's also a lake where I saw a few people on row boats. Lots of green space for picnicking, relaxing, and to let the kids and dogs roam freely. The picture taking opportunities seem to be endless. It's truly and striking park from all angles.

A nice security guard answered our question with that and we had to go back to get our materials and when trying to check back in not even 5 minutes later our tickets wouldn't work because we had already checked in and somehow they didn't remember Just seeing us and started to make a fuss until we got the security guard again. The emails you receive from the museum do not cover any of this information like most places in Spain. We had plenty of time with the audio tour. There is staff in almost every room, but they weren't helping with keeping people and children at a respectful talking level or telling them to go to shared areas to visit with one another and every piece is behind glass so it's not like anyone was going to touch and ruin the paintings so I'm not sure what they are in each room for.

I purchased our tickets online for about 14\u20ac each. We had to select an entry time and our tickets included access to an extra exhibition too. At the time the exhibition showcased was from Carmen Calvo, featuring mixed media artwork, dolls, masks, and a really intriguing closed room with peepholes. I'm all for unconventional and even provocative art, but I found this exhibition a bit unsettling, particularly due to its inclusion of inappropriate images of nude children. The rest of the museum actually dedicated to Picasso's work was fantastic!  Such a fun educational and cultural experience for individuals of all ages! I would recommend spending the extra money on audio guides for further insight into the artwork. While I still enjoyed the experience, I wish I had taken advantage of the option for audio guides to further enhance my understanding. The museum's chronological arrangement took us on a journey through the stages of Picasso's career, allowing us to see his progression as an artist and different stylistic phases.

I'm not a huge fan or follower of Picasso's artwork, but visiting this museum is rated as one of the top attractions in Barcelona. So of course, I wanted to check it out for myself. I really wanted to do a guided tour, but they sell out months in advance. Unfortunately, I didn't know this ahead of time. Luckily I was able to snag an admission ticket about 6 weeks in advance as these often sell out quickly as well. I didn't do a lot of research before my visit,  but this museum focuses primarily on Picasso's early works of art. One of the first rooms that you'll see features a large wall that's full of hundreds of Picasso's rough sketches. I mean, the man was clearly talented. As you continue through the museum, the sketches progress to some of his earliest oil paintings, sculptures, and pottery work. While I did find many of these pieces to be interesting, I was a bit underwhelmed as a whole. Again, I'm not an avid follower of Picasso, but I guess I was expecting to see some of his more popular art pieces. I also feel like some background information on the pieces would have been extremely helpful for me, so I really missed out by not being able to book a guided tour. Nevertheless, his artwork is still pretty amazing to see up close and personal. Not sure if I'd come back again since I felt like I got as much as I could out of the exhibits. However, I do feel like a tour is essential to establish some kind of connection to the art. This is especially true if you don't already follow his work.

Montserrat is quite far away and takes awhile to get there. Montserrat is a beautiful area and you can get a nice view of the area because it's higher up in the mountains, but there is basically just the one church containing the black Madonna. I'd suggest taking the 20 minute hike to the scenic point at the cross as you look out. They do give you a tasting of a few of the liquors that the nuns make there, i was tempted to buy one as i thought it would go good with an espresso based drink.The wine tour of Oller del Mas with tapas wasn't very good the wines were ok. They offered tasting of their 3 cheapest wines and then explained the other other wines which you could purchase a glass or a bottle to take home of if you want. All their wines are organic so that's something different than most wineries. I thought the last red they offered was pretty good, a merlot blend. The tapas offered were kind of a let down. It was more of a charcuterie plate, cheese, salami, cured ham, and a tiny croquette and tortilla and a piece of cake. Pretty much the worst tapas I've had in Spain.Overall it's a long trip for just the one church housing the black Madonna with a wine tour. The guides were great and gave good information the bus was clean and the ride was smooth, the wines were okay, the tapas were disappointing.

I just recently visited the Dewey monument in Union Square (San Fran), and it marks the US Navy defeating the Spanish armada in Manila Bay, in 1898. Thus, loosening their global grip and lessening their military victories. Still, as of today, Spain has the 14th largest GDP, so economically, it's still very relevant. Glad to celebrate my Spanish roots (5% per 23 and me) and it was cool to see all the similarities between the Philippines and Spain. In fact, they fast track citizenship for Filipinos wishing to immigrate, due to this historical relationship.

Barcelona's Montju\u00efc is a broad shallow hill, of which eastern side is almost a sheer cliff, giving it a commanding view over the City's harbour immediately below. The top of the hill was the site of several fortifications, the latest of which (the Castell de Montju\u00efc) remains today. The Castell once served as a prison and on different occasions during the Spanish Civil War, both Nationalists and Republicans were executed there, each at the time when the site was held by their opponents. The Franco regime continued the tradition.  Naturally wooded, the slopes of the Montju\u00efc were traditionally used to grow food and graze animals by the people of the neighbouring Ciutat Vella. In the 1890s, the forests were partially cleared, opening space for parklands. The site was selected to host the 1929 International Exposition (a World's Fair), for which the first large-scale construction on the hill began. The surviving buildings from this effort include the grand Palau Nacional, the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic (Olympic stadium), the ornate Font M\u00e0gica fountains, and a grand staircase leading up from the foot of Montju\u00efc. The Poble Espanyol, a \"Spanish village\" of different buildings built in different styles of Spanish architecture, also survives. The roads in the slopes facing the city were also once the Montju\u00efc circuit Formula One racing circuit, hosting the Spanish Grand Prix on four occasions.The 1992 Summer Olympics were centered here and during our bus ride through, Gayle and I saw not only the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic (with a large family event going on inside), but also the Anella Ol\u00edmpica (the \"Olympic Ring\") of sporting venuesm including the Palau Sant Jordiindoor arena, the Institut Nacional d'Educaci\u00f3 F\u00edsica de Catalunya, a centre of sports science; the Piscines Bernat Picornell and the Piscina Municipal de Montju\u00efc, the venues for swimming and diving events respectively.

Everything blends ridiculously perfect.Tuna Belly with Sea Urchin Montadito - Another must order!!! Out of this world.Oysters & Caviar Montadito - Very fresh & delicious oysters. My 3rd favorite tapas from here.Shrimps & Caviar Montadito w/ Greek Yogurt & Truffled Honey - It's delicious, but practically similar to the smoked salmon tapas. The caviar gives it a different touch, but I'd rather get the salmon.Iberian Pork Cheeks - The meat's very strong & distinct tasting. The meat by itself's not my favorite, I've had better in other places. It's salty on its own, but the olive gives it flavor. The cheese's very sweet & the peppers're sweet and bitter.

We tried a plethora of drinks and tapas and all of them were amazing. The highlights were definitely the prawns with caviar, the pork cheek, and the loquat dessert.

Because you will experience brand new tastes here.   ---   ---   ---I've been on the Earth 39 years and I've probably eaten 49 years worth of food, but I have never tasted something quite like the loquats with anchovies. Quimet & Quimet was the first place I visited upon landing in Barcelona and the loquats with anchovies was my first bite. For those wondering, a loquat is an apricot. There were other things present on this bite, but I'm not sure what they were. It was recommended to take the whole thing as one bite, and I listen to people who confidently instruct me on things when I'm in a foreign land. The experience was:Sweet Apricot....... still sweet, still sweet.... SALT. My tongue convulsed. Not out of fear of displeasure, but via a natural reaction to experiencing something for the first time ever. Imagine if you lived nearly 40 years and never sneezed. What would that first one be like? It'd be like flying across the Atlantic, taking a quick power nap in the hotel, walking to Quimet & Quimet, asking the server for what I should get for my first meal ever in Spain, and then eating the loquat with anchovies. 5-stars.I ordered a couple of other items, but to be honest, I was confused as to which thing was what. It's quite possible that the photos I uploaded have some of the wrong captions. One was the smoked oyster with red pepper and the other was the Iberian pork cheek. Both of these were enjoyable, but I wouldn't need to order them again. I did love the red pepper though. 4-stars.And then the highlight of the experience was the Salmon, yoghurt and truffles honey montadito. This might have the been the best thing I ate during my two days in Barcelona. I need to find more truffle honey in my life, apparently. This was the perfect food. 100-stars. DO NOT come here without ordering this.As everyone else points out, this entire establishment is maybe the size of a typical master bedroom.

Based on his recommendation, for Tapas, we ordered Baby Beans with Codfish and Loquats with Anchovies.  Both were exquisite!

One reason is its originality - unlike the traditional tapas on sale elsewhere, they serve more carefully crafted small bites with higher end toppings, but still super cheap. The one downside is they are super small, which means you will likely have to wait. Thursday around 6, though, the wait for two was only about 10 minutes. They are also standing room only, and due to the size, it is not good for crowds. Look past that though, because the food is phenomenal. My fave: the scallop and caviar \"sandwich,\" which is basically a small round pastry crust topped with the items. It is a few bites for just a few Euros, but it is spectacular, and thanks for the size, you can easily sample a few items.

Dave would step away and order for us and when the food arrives, we get detailed information about the traditional Catalonian faire. Dave was also very accommodating to one in our group who didn't drink, and made great substitution offerings. The walking, eating, &  drinking is the perfect amount. Here's a cliff note version: 1. cheese & wine2. tapas & vermut3. tapas & wine4. desserts & cavaI bought a bottle of Vermut (7 Euro) from one of the stops.  I made few friends and continued to get after dinner drinks at the bars Dave recommended. Moreover, Dave booked a birthday reservation for me at a place that I would have never found on my own. Truly a personal experience like no other, go alone or grab friends, this a must do. Buy the Vermut, go with an open mind, and your pallet will venture new levels guaranteed.

Yes, it's a random place in the middle of Rambla Del Ravel, but luckily it was a beautiful day in Barcelona, and I decided to walk and play a little game of solo scavenger hunt. The Ravel is in a little area surrounded between Las Ramblas and the Mercat de Sant Antoni. This area has some great hidden restaurants, bars, and shops. The narrow lanes make this area very unique and interesting. This wonderful monument cat was created by Fernando Botero and stands independently. The cat looks small in pictures, but is actually huge and taller than any man! I was able to find some nice young ladies that took wonderful photos of me. Many people talk about pickpocketing in the area, luckily, I was aware of it but didn't experience any of it. I kept my things very close to me and wore my bag in front of me at all times.

Actual dine-in date: 3/6/2019.Whenever traveling internationally I try my best to experience one \"special occasion\" meal. It may or may not be a chef's table or fine dining experience, but the restaurant would have enough accolades for people to schedule their itineraries or even plane tickets on a reservation. In the case of Barcelona I am a huge Europhile and a United Cyber Monday deal had me already going here but it was in the case of Tickets that I scheduled my entire trip around the reservation.Compared to TFL and Noma scoring tickets here was slightly easier... but not by much. Reservations are available up to 60 days to the date of dine-in and open up at 12AM exactly. At the time you had to not only be on the website at midnight local time, your computer time also had to match the local time in order for the reservation system to work. You could be SOL as early as 5 minutes afterwards so it's best to try out a \"practice run\" beforehand. Also keep in mind that the minimum party size is 2. Being a solo traveler I reached out to a girls travel FB group for a dining partner. This ended up being one of the best things that ever happened on my travels.Dress code: smart casual.For background research I highly recommend watching Netflix's \"Chef's Table\" season 5 episode 4 on Albert Adri\u00e0. As one of the two Adri\u00e0 brothers he was instrumental to the success of El Bulli as its pastry chef and eventually its creative director. As the creative director he was the one that spearheaded all the avant-garde techniques that to this day define molecular gastronomy (foams, spherification). No longer wanting to be in the shadow of his famous brother Ferran he left El Bulli and went to start his own collective of restaurants in Barcelona. Think of Tickets as a scaled down El Bulli.My friend and I first started off in the main restaurant where the savories are served. Technically there *is* a menu but most people who go to Tickets opt for omakase style - once you tell the server your allergies and dislikes they'll proceed to give you \"la vida tapa\" until you say stop. There is no mention of any budget concerns, but considering you are eating at a World's 50 Best restaurant I assume you saved enough to splurge on the experience...Once you are done with the savories dessert is served in a separate room that reminds you of something from either Willy Wonka or Alice in Wonderland. Again the same concept applies here - dessert is served until you say \"stop\". The dessert room itself is a very unique experience amongst all restaurant experiences - I'd rather not say what I thought but rather experience it for yourself.Between my friend and I we shared approximately 20 tapas.- Anchoa (anchovies)- Olivas Gordal Adobad (the famous olives from \"El Bulli\" that are made from olive juice via a spherification process)- Caballa simesabe (their take on \"pan de cristal con tomate\" accompanied with mackerel) - Calamar raifort (squid in 6 grains)- Duo atun (two preparations of tuna: tuna tartare plus tuna bonbon)- Airbaguette de Rubia (their take on jamon iberico on a baguette - I think the jamon is from Galicia)- Ostra escabeche (pickled oysters)- Mini Airbags de ques (think cheese puff with manchego cheese foam on the inside) - Viaje nordico (Beet and tartar on a cracker - their take on something you would see at Noma's game & forest menu)- Gamba Steackmar (aka amaebi - sweet shrimp)- Maracusante (little peas inside of a passion fruit seed - another molecular gastronomy trick)- Albondigas de habita (peas that look like meatballs?)- Berenjena lacada (lacquered eggplant)- Mollete papada (a sandwich made from pork chin - think dumpling) - Codorniz wellington (quail done in the beef wellington style. Filled with spinach, mushrooms and ham)- Bikini trufa (sandwich of Coulommier cheese and black truffle)- Rosa de ambar (one of the signature desserts, a gelatinous ball resembling dew sits on the center of the rose. The dew tastes like lychee and raspberry).- Tickets cheesecake (a cheesecake that looks like a cheese wheel. Served with \"crackers\" I am not a cheesecake person and this is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The rind is super delicious; very hazelnut rich) - Tarta Choco Pasion (regular chocolate tart)- Sandwich Helado (stroopwaffle ice cream sandwich)With drinks, grand total came out to \u20ac335.30.Favorites: the olives, sweet shrimp, cheese puff with manchego, truffle cheese sandwich, cheesecake. I didn't get to go to El Bulli when it was open so going to Tickets is the next best thing. A few years back I also went to another \"El Bulli\" alumni's restaurant - \u00e9 by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, aka Tickets as a chef's table. I prefer tickets over \u00e9 because even though the techniques may be similar, the focus remains on the food.To this day one of my favorite foodie experiences.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Aug 31, 2021"}, {"review": "The food was really amazing!

You can make them online, but they are available once it is 2 months in advance at midnight Barcelona time. I was on their website exactly then and was able to make a 10pm reservation. After that, it was fully booked for the day. Service was pleasant and attentive. The place feels very casual. Doesn't feel dressy or formal, which makes it more comfortable in my opinion. We did the \"chefs choice\" option which is where they keep serving you dishes until you tell them you're nearing full, so they wrap up the courses. If you do want something in particular you could let the server know. It was really hard to decided what all to get, which is why we just left it up to them to decide. We had about 10 or so items and 3 desserts. Loved the creative ways things were prepared. Quality of ingredients was also great. They also had the best sangria compared to all the other ones I've had during my entire 2 weeks in Spain. It's the least \"watered\" down. I really wish we had more room in our stomachs because the desserts were also super good! I would've loved to try more. Didn't know how much the bill would come out to be, but to our surprise, it wasn't too bad for the food and experience. 210 euros for 2 people.

Some places live up to it, while others fall on the sword of their own making. Thankfully, Tickets completely lived up to the hype! It actually surpassed the hype, to be fair. Sadly, we've only been able to get in once on our growing number of visits to the city, but I really can't say enough positive things about the restaurant. From the staff to the food, everything was excellent. The atmosphere is fun, and completely unpretentious, which is the best. It's casual, which may surprise some, but that really helps take a sometimes-intimidating world of gastronomy and make it relaxing. Easily the most relaxed \"fancy\" meal we've ever had!We allowed our server to simply pick whatever he felt would be best, and he didn't let us down! We had a wonderful variety of dishes, spanning any number of textures and flavors you could want. He answered any questions that we had, explained the dishes well, and was just a generally pleasant server with a fun attitude. I could run through the list of items that we had, but I'd just say let them pick and enjoy. The pacing is great, and they'll constantly check in to see if you want to continue or if you're too full. Again, it's a very chill place!Also, while Tickets isn't \"cheap,\" I can say that we were amazed at how fairly-priced our meal ended up being. We've spent far more on meals in the States that weren't even close to deserving the fanfare that Tickets does. So, at the risk of making our chances of getting in even harder, I can only say that Tickets is a must-visit if you can get in, and enjoy the experience!

A very good meal, but honestly given the reputation I was a little underwhelmed by the creativity of the dishes (except desert, which was exceptional). Still enjoyable, and honestly I probably would've rated this very high if I hadn't gone to Disfrutar a couple days prior. It's very hard to get in - you have to book reservations two months out on Spain's time at the moment they release. When you show up, you check in and get your 'tickets' for the meal and head to your table. You can order a la carte, or have them choose a selection of dishes for you (not advertised as a tasting menu, but similar concept). We went with their choice, overall the courses were well executed and flavors were on point, but some weren't particularly exciting. Favorite courses were all of the desserts - the cheesecake, ice cream sandwich, pizza, tart and key lime pie were insanely good. For savory bites, my favorites were the olive spheres (obviously - they're most creative/innovative dish), the squid, eel and foie gras, meat on the cone, and carrot canape. Only issue with the meal for me, was the timing of courses. It started out good, but then more and more spaced as if they were dragging out the meal on purpose (which, they probably were to space out timing for the dessert room). The last few courses took what felt like forever, and by the time we got to the dessert room we wanted to go (overall, not an overly long meal maybe 3 hours, but without knowing how many courses or what the plan was it made it difficult to judge timing of everything. I would definitely come back to Tickets, but would probably want to try the other Michelin restaurants in BCN first (that are easier to get into).", "rating": "5", "visited": "Aug 11, 2019"}, {"review": "Getting a ticket to Tickets Barcelona is no easy feat. The word is out - this may be the best value fine dining in the city, if not the world. The tapas here are a mix of elBulli's greatest hits, along with equally impressive new creations. You can order a la carte or opt for the tasting menu. After dinner, you may even be invited to the secret dessert room, a willy wonka-esque wonderland complete with a ceiling covered in gigantic berries and candy canes.We weren't able to get reservations at first and my husband had to practically beg Enigma (the latest and greatest elBarri family restaurant) to help us. Enigma came through and got us a 10:30pm weeknight seating! It definitely helped to make a reservation at another elBarri restaurant and leverage that.Still full from the 40+ tasting menu at Enigma the night prior, we opted for the a la carte option at Tickets. With two drinks each, a satisfying amount of tapas, and plenty of dessert, the meal ended up being a reasonable \u20ac100 per person. Considering Tickets is ranked #25 on the World's 50 Best, holds 1 Michelin star, and is one of my top meals ever, this was quite a steal.A highlight were the King Crab Tacos - this was a fun, make your own dish. Not to mention the crab was the best crab I've tasted, with the most tender texture! I also loved the Mini Airbags, which had an awesome Manchego foam center. The eye-catching Crunchy Octopus was also a hit with a zippy wasabi-panko breading that went nicely with the tender octopus.The bright white wine we enjoyed with dinner was also standout and a great value at \u20ac8 a glass. The craft cocktails were well-balanced and equally as enjoyable.As good as the savory courses were, I thought the desserts were even more impressive. On first bite, the cheesecake immediately took the title of the best dessert I've had! Shaped like a cheese round, it had a subtle hazelnut white chocolate outer \"rind\" and the fluffiest, yet decadent center. The texture, along with the balanced sweetness was better than any cheesecake of my dreams.After that legendary showing, I wasn't sure if I could enjoy any other dessert, but the ice cream stroopwaffle and chocolate passionfruit flower were nearly as good! Like the cheesecake, there wasn't one particular thing that stood out, rather every single aspect was just incredible.

He was able to book a table for us and two of our friends who happen to be traveling in Barcelona as well.Their menu is fun and eclectic, and the atmosphere is vivacious and colorful. The staff are friendly, energetic, and seem very excited to give you a one-of-a-kind experience. You can order right off the menu, but we decided to go for the tasting menu - why not???The most surprising bite during the entire meal was the olive. It's not really an olive, but tastes just like an olive and looks like an olive... oh, that olive... This is not to say that this was the best bite. Every bite of every plate they offered was amazingly delicious, and if you ask, the servers will bring you the menu for you to order other food items in addition to whatever is included. The hubs was severely disappointed that we didn't get to try the crab... after they served the last entree/savory dish, they asked us if we needed anything else. We were so lost in all the flavors and textures that we totally forgot to ask if we can order the crab. Big mistake.Once you tell them you're good, they whisk you off to another section of the restaurant where it's a complete different world of fruits and sweets all around. Here, they served another series of amazing desserts. This time, we made sure to ask for the menu to see if we wanted to try anything else before the last bite. We ordered the Stroopwaffle Ice Cream Sandwich, and I am SO glad we did - it was my favorite dessert at the restaurant.

I found Barcelona Free Tours on Yelp as they had raving 5-star reviews. I signed up on their website and voila, that was it! Quick and simple. The day before the trip I received a confirmation reminder that stated the time to meet as well as the meeting location.At 15:00, I was able to find the tour guides at the meeting location near the Placa de Catalunya, near the fountain. The tour guides will be holding a purple umbrella and wearing purple shirts (very helpful). They will check you in and then ask you a couple questions: How did you find out about the tour? How long are you in Barcelona? Will you be going to Madrid?The tour guides provide several different tours that include: A Gothic Quarter tour, a tour around Passeig de Garcia and Segalla Famila Church, an underground tour that includes taking the metro and also a tour of Barcelona's cannabis locations and history on how that started (sounded really cool). However, I decided to take the Gothic Quarter tour with the lovely and handsome John!There was a total of 16 people on the tour which I thought was a great amount! John was absolutely educational and really took his time to explain the history around the area. He also was nice enough to send a list of additional local restaurants and bars around the area, upon email request.Some things I learned on the tour:*Barcelona has a really big penguin population and they get it, locals don't like them; although the visitors always think it's cool to feed them (disgusting if you ask me!) Anywho, Barcelona is trying to reduce the penguin population in the most non-animal cruelty way possible. Therefore, the vendors around the Placa de Catalunya area have penguin food that they feed them, but the food has birth control in it. Haha! I thought that was absolutely funny! Is it just me? Humm.*Barcelona is such a diverse city that attracts visitors from all over with their amazing beaches!* The tour gave me a better idea of the Gothic Quarter, Born District and Las Ramblas* I saw the Santa Maria del Pi that took 70 years to build; wowzers!*Pi is the Catalan world for Pine.This was such a great tour that I recommend to everyone, it's so rich in history. And the best part? It's a free tour, however, once the tour is complete you pay what you think the tour was worth.

I bought the chocolate experience which includes a tour and a choice of activity for 65 euros for 2 people. What a deal. We had the most amazing tour guide who taught us how to make bon bon, clusters , lolipops and candy bars . She was so friendly and nice and taught us a little catalan too. The chocolate tastes amazing and we were encouraged to eat and taste as we went. She spoke great english too and the museum is really cool with all the chocolate scuplures. Chocolatiers in Spain definitely focus on chocolate as a sculpting medium. And make beautiful things out of it. This is the highlight so far of my trip. I highly recommend if you love chocolate , want to learn about its history and make some chocolate too to take home! We have pounds of chocolate now. Spent 3 hours there.

The front gallery are artifacts and placards detailing the cultural, commercial, and technological history of chocolate, from Mayan times to the industrial age.  On the outside wall in the same long room are display cases featuring some modern chocolate creations, such as a Don Quixote scene, a Ben Hur scene, St. George and the Dragon, the Gaudi lizard from Parc Guell, et al (see photos).Further along is a series of audiovisual rooms, each with a short presentation on the history of chocolate to complement the static displays preceding.  Towards the back are some placards and photographs describing the great pastry artists and chocolatiers of Barcelona's past and present.  Also in this section you will find old chocolate-making machines.If the ticket-chocolate is enough to satisfy your sweet tooth, you have a free bit to take with you (or to eat whilst perusing the exhibits, if you can't wait, like some people I know).  If not, the front of the museum, at the beginning and end of the loop, is the museum shop, where you can purchase all types of chocolates and truffles.

I ain't a rug, OK? However, it's acceptable to call the architectural style Antoni Gaudi used in the design of his first house as Oriental. The building has a Persian/Moroccan flavor with the constant use of decorative tiles, illustrated ceilings, and Moorish arches. It's not my favorite Gaudi building, not by a long shot, but it's a good starter course if you have time.It's up in the quieter Gracia neighborhood away from the crowds at the other Gaudi landmarks, but it's worth the trek. The grounds are unique in integrating the interior and exterior elements into a seamless picture of nature. There's a heavy dose of exotic Asian flair (...hey, I didn't say Oriental) in the ridged framing, the shape of the eaves, and the rampant idiosyncratic decorative touches.

I booked the English tour only because of the time was more convenient, but since everyone in our group spoke Spanish the guide did the tour in Spanish instead, which made it even better.

He was very nice and knowledgeable about the history of the house and of Gaud\u00ed as well.

After taking little time to admire the architecture, I was shown quickly to my front row seat and provided with a complimentary drink which was a very nice touch.The lights dimmed and the show began with the musicians setting the atmosphere in the small and intimate space. The closest thing I can compare it to in my experience is an invocation of the spirit that one might experience in church. The cantaor (singer) and the tocaor (guitar player) drew me in from the start. By the time the Baile began I was lost in the experience. In this space their was a mixing and meeting of cultures that was so beautiful it reminded me that we humans are capable of coming together making something beautiful and meaningful when we set aside things that divide us.

All great textures and tastes and well varied.Sangria at the first stop, vermouth at the second stop and lots of terrific local red wine at the third stop.Throughout this time, great interactions with the other folks on the tour (there were a total of eight of us, plus Zoltan and another tour guide who was training), lots of time to talk, enjoy, eat and drink.

No, you won't find it published on the official tour guide or in the Catalan Better Busines guide references. Located along the hip section of La Rambla you enter from the street but climb the stairs to the second floor where, for a minor admission fee you can enter and see a small collection or erotic items, a few historic, a few being meaningless nonsense and others sort of on the artistic scale of things. It is neither as good as the erotic museum of Miami nor the equal of the one in New York or in Amsterdam, but amusing. After all, how many how many erotic museums are there anyway?

Once we figured out where our complimentary glass of cava could be found, we winded our way through the exhibits. I was expecting a tourist trap akin to the Ripley's Believe It Or Not locations scattered around the U.S., but I found in the Erotic Museum a genuine effort to educate. They had a guest speaker talking about BDSM. The had rooms focused on cultural attitudes toward sex and eroticism. There was a tiny art gallery of original works, as well as some prints from Picasso and Dali that might be deemed erotic -- but they're actually just cool.There is room for improvement. They have a lackluster room dedicated to Marilyn Monroe. The cost of admission could include a bit of AC. Also, there are crass elements to the museum (Guinness Book of World Sex Records and the souvenirs, namely, which are at the end of the tour) that seem to go against the spirit of the museum. Does the museum want us to snicker and giggle about sex, or see the intrinsic and artistic value of the erotic in societies past and present?

However, I'm so glad I decided to stop by! What I anticipated would be a quick trip turned out to be amazing from the get-go.My partner and I visited after completing an 8-mile run, so we were quite tired, but we powered through and it was well worth it. We spent around 2-2.5 hours exploring and saw almost everything. We arrived right at opening at 10 am and appreciated how empty it was at first, but it got increasingly crowded as time passed.I was impressed with the enclosures because there were numerous viewpoints for each animal, ensuring a good view no matter where the animal was located. However, it could seem intrusive if they wanted some peace and quiet.Upon entering, the first two enclosures we saw were the prairie dog, standing up adorably on guard, and the otter. The otter was incredibly cute and curious, following us around as we moved through the enclosure.My favorite animal, the Pygmy hippo, was present in the zoo with two of them! Additionally, I enjoyed the extensive collection of marmosets, the Komodo dragon, and the up-close view of the lion and invertebrate exhibit.It was disheartening to see their apes in less-than-optimal conditions. One lowland gorilla kept covering her ears with her hands, and I was informed by a volunteer that several of them have mental health problems. Additionally, a chimp had visible wounds near their eye and knuckles. While I understand they're being well-cared for and are highly intelligent creatures, it still saddened me.Unfortunately, several areas/enclosures were under construction, including the red pandas, and the leopards and wolves were not on display during my visit.

Located in the Cuitadella Park, itself created out of the Bourbon fortress from which it takes its name, this is a traditional city zoo spread over thirteen hectares. Although constrained by the development around it, the zoo is attractively laid out with lots of trees and small areas of gardens, and a visit here could easily occupy a whole day - if you've sufficient stamina! Containing over 4,000 animals from 400 species, it covers most of the main groups that you expect to see in a zoo, from zebras and tigers, through apes, monkeys, deer, penguins, hippos, elephants, and assorted reptiles and birds. There is a small dolphinarium with regular shows, but a more grisly (and accordingly popular) attraction is feeding time in the reptile house, when live mice are fed to the snakes. Definitely not for the squeamish. Great efforts have also been made to modernise the enclosures and, although some of them are still small for the animals they contain (especially large mammals), there are no old-fashioned cells with iron grills. The conditions are rather better for the smaller animals, birds and lizards, with some attempt to recreate elements from their natural environments. Whether you find such conditions acceptable or distressing is up to you, but there's no doubt that it is hugely popular, and a great place to bring children, who are well catered for. The zoo has a long history of research, education and conservation, and the descriptions of the animals are correspondingly well done, in Spanish, Catalan and English. As well as several cafeterias and lots of self-service stations selling bottled drinks, there are picnic spots, two well-stocked shops, left luggage lockers, pony rides in summer, and a 'train' service which operates on a set route through the zoo, providing respite for tired feet. The zoo lays on programmes and tours for schools during term time, as well as special family days, and birthday parties. Much of the zoo is accessible for wheelchairs, although some of the ramps are rather steep. The prices are a little steep too, but then there is a lot to see, and someone has to pay for all that animal feed...

If you're there for the views, there's a walkway along the outer perimeter of the fort on the side facing the port that provides fairly expansive views.

Its full name was the Colonia Iulia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino, or Barcino for short. Founded by Emperor Augustus, the colonia was founded as a means of distributing land amongst retired soldiers with an incentive to guard its conquered territories as there was no standing army. Its importance as a city was significantly less so as the main city of that region was then Tarraco. Fast forward many centuries later, when the construction of the Via Laietana (a major street parallel to Las Ramblas) precluded the moving of  Casa Padell\u00e0s from its previous location in Mercaders to its current location in Pla\u00e7a del Rei, which once housed the rulers of Catalonia. When some artifacts were found from the ancient city a full excavation took place. The ruins also unearthed parts of the city that developed after the Roman empire fell and Christianity became the dominant religion throughout Europe. When the Visigoths took over they realized that Barcino was more suited to them than Tarraco and took over the city, turning it into a political and religious center in its own right - Barcinona.The Museu d`Hist\u00f2ria de Barcelona (MUHBA) complex comprises of several heritage sites scattered about the city spanning across many time periods. The premier heritage site is Pla\u00e7a del Rei, where \u20ac7 admission includes an audioguide and also covers admission to the non-free MUHBA sites.

The visit to MUHBA Pla\u00e7a del Rei was much more pleasant, as the included audioguide and 10-minute introductory video at the beginning of your visit give you plenty of background information needed to understand your visit, plus the audioguide tracks and signage supplement the major sights as to give even the most history-averse person enough context to make sense of what they are looking at. Plus being situated indoors, the climate control certainly helps.Compared to the Roman Forum, I also was intrinsically more interested in the ruins themselves as the excavation site contained the following:- A fullonica and tinctoria (a site to do laundry and dye garments).- Cetaria (a site to salt fish and produce fish-based sauces, with the most important being garum, which was highly prized)- Winemaking facilitiesMore remains from Barcino when the Roman empire fell and Christianity took over such as a baptismal font, bishop's palace and early church. A lot of the church remains are underneath the modern Barcelona CathedralThe structure of the ruins themselves are so well-organized that as you walk through them you can literally see the evolution of the city throughout history.I was pleasantly surprised by my visit as this was my first visit to Roman ruins that I was able to understand the context of the ruins in relation to the history during my visit as opposed to doing more research after-the-fact. By visiting MUHBA Pla\u00e7a del Rei you get another perspective of the city that predates Gaud\u00ed and his works. Being able to see multiple different historical perspectives of the city in one visit is one reason why Barcelona is considered one of my most favorite cities in Europe.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Jul 6, 2019"}, {"review": "The Museu d'Hist\u00f2ria de Barcelona (aka MUHBA or the Barcelona City History Museum) is less of a museum and more of a walking underground tour of the archaeological ruins of the ancient Roman city of Barcino.

There is a small selection of high-quality artifacts on display at various points, but the labyrinths steal the show. Roman laundries, workshops, wineries, early churches, a bishop's palace and roads are all explored via a series of elevated walkways. Displays are in Spanish and Catalan, with some English, but a comprehensive audio guided tour is included in the price, in a wide number of languages. If I have a criticism, it's that despite all the effort that has clearly been made, the interpretation is often still rather confusing, especially for such large and complex three-dimensional sites. It's also a very long walk underground, so children may begin to get a bit bored and elderly people tired (there are some seats to rest along the way, but not that many). The tour finishes with the chance to visit the impressive chapel of St Agata and the 14th-Century Hall of the Royal Palace, known as the Salo de Tinell. Here the inquisition met, and the steps leading to the Placa del Rei are where Ferdinand and Isabella stood to receive Columbus on his return from the Americas.

The tour group consisted of a lovely couple from Philly, me, and our tour guide, Cesc, who was also our translator, driver, and local historian for the day. His engaging personality and enthusiasm for food, locals, and history was evident and I felt welcomed to be part of the tour and in Catalan country. Although I don't mind traveling alone, it felt like I was traveling with friends on this tour. The tour itself exceeded my expectations. I was provided an overview of the list of activities we were going to do that day:- Traditional Catalan breakfast at a renowned rural restaurant.- 2 visits and tasting to artisan food producers (sausages-embotits/cheese)- Visit and tasting to a winery (small/family run and interesting projects with local varieties)- Lunch (tasting menu) at a Catalan cuisine restaurant.But the actual tour itself was so much more. Cesc provided so much in-depth information and history about each location and even the foods we ate.

There's options to work with them privately (and many international chefs and small tour groups do) but if you're flying solo or in a couple then join one of their scheduled tours exploring the city or go the whole hog and join one of their full day countryside trips. I have now taken two tours and the recent countryside tour was an epic food exploration in to the heart of Catalonia. Wear your stretchy pants and heed the warning of \"DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST\" because this 12 hour extravaganza of local produce, beautiful scenery, colourful characters and endless food is going to take stamina and a large appetite. Each trip is different, curated by the team at Aborigens from their massive network of food and beverage contacts in the region. Alex (our host) drove our group of seven in to the countryside and helped us to explore and understand the food culture of Catalonia. We ate no less than six different types of pork sausage, beans, eggs and bread for breakfast at acclaimed \"Els Casals\". After a very rich start to the day, we spent a little time with the chef before visiting his farm where the pigs are raised before making their way in to sausage form...circle of life, right? Next, a drive to visit a farm house that has been owned by the same family for over 500 years. Here we saw a flour mill running on the power of the river and ate cheese that is highly regarded by top city chefs. It was a humble and beautiful setting and the older couple who owned the farmhouse were gorgeous. They took great pride in showing us their property, underground cheese cellar and paraphernalia around their pond. Next was lunch at \"Can Poal\" in Vallromanes where we somehow had room for glasses of cava,  various salted cod items and a beautiful tomato and watermelon gazpacho... all before we ate gigantic plates of luxurious rice filled with prawns and squid. Amazing.Just when we were ready to collapse in to food comas, we came to our final stop to meet a wine maker who makes wine only from Pansa Blanca grapes.  We sampled various interpretations, including avery herbal Vermut, and chatted to the owner (with Alex translating) for an hour or so. The day Alex organised was excellent and we enjoyed his obvious enthusiasm and knowledge for food and beverage culture not only in Catalonia, but beyond. In the days afterwards he sent us recommendations for Seville, San Sebastian and Madrid where we were to visit later, and we continued to enjoy his suggestions.

During a work trip, I scheduled a morning market tour to sample some of the local fare in Barcelona. The tour ended up consisting of just a married couple and myself due to some last minute cancellations by another party. Alex was our tour guide, and his tour wasted no time picking up steam. We met at 9 AM and had eaten at least a dozen samples from local artisans at the Galvany Market by 10 AM. The tour was very well organized and each vendor was ready with samples when we arrived at their station. We tried blood sausage, different types of charcuterie, cured fish, fried fish, and fresh fruit among other things. After the market, Alex took us to a local cheese and ham shop where we sampled different grades of Iberian ham and cheese. We had so much leftover that I got to take a lot of the very expensive ham home for a midnight snack. The tour continued on to a local pub where we enjoyed some pickled anchovies. By this time, I was absolutely stuffed, but we still had a famous chocolate shop to visit as well as a high end caf\u00e9 where we enjoyed wine with some cooked local dishes.During the tour, Alex received a notification that one of the people on a tour group he was leading tomorrow cancelled. He mentioned that they would be truffle hunting with dogs. This piqued my interest as I love truffles and absolutely adore dogs (I have a shepherd mix myself). I ended up signing up to spend the whole day on another tour consisting of an olive oil farm, a truffle plantation, and a seven-course truffle meal.This second tour was a full day of learning and eating! I don't remember being so stuffed in recent memory. We started the day at the olive oil farm in rural Catalonia, with a massive breakfast and olive oil tasting.  We then took a tour of the grounds and then were whisked away on a private bus to the truffle plantation, where we spent a few hours outside with a truffle expert + three of his very adorable dogs. While the dogs were hunting, the truffle expert educated us on the different types of truffles and what regions they were from and what the process is for growing and selling them. I was amazed to learn that from the time you plant your first tree, it can take 10 years to see your first truffle in your plantation. The day was productive as we finished with ~1200 g of truffles.  Finally, we ended the day at the restaurant of a famous chef outside Barcelona who is known for his use of mushrooms and truffles. We had a seven-course truffle tasting that included a chocolate cake with shaved truffles that was surprisingly very tasty. My first trip to Barcelona was so memorable thanks to Aborigens!

Alex did a great job of talking with us about what we like, what were interested in when figuring out where to go and what to eat.  We are pretty interested in food, and food culture and Alex was a wealth of information regarding everything from the roots of some of the most traditional food, to the techniques being used in some of the most modern kitchens.

Taking the direct route from the traffic roundabout (and nearest metro station, as well as many bus stops) to the front entrance entails many stairs. Plan a good 10 minutes to walk up, that is if you don't stop for photos along the way. From the side streets, where I came from, there is the option of outdoor escalators (how novel! I haven't seen many outdoor ones before) for part of the trek upwards. Upon entering the ticket counter is to the left/center right inside the door, there is the option to purchase online though I bought them in person and it took only a few minutes with no line on a Friday in September. The ground floor lobby is right beyond the counters and provides direct access to the 6 main areas of the museum - Medieval Gothic art, Medieval Romanesque art, Renaissance and Baroque art, Modern art, Numismatics (coins and medals), and the main auditorium/atrium which also contains the cafe and a massive pipe organ. The exhibits were very thorough and for the most part chronological. I was impressed by their extensive Romanesque fresco collection and maintenance, and also enjoyed the modern art and Art Nouveau/Art Deco furniture collection. Walking around the total museum can easily take 2-3 hours, more if you want to read all the descriptions.

They said we did not have to buy the picture, but they would show it to us later on and it would be up to us to purchase it. The main attraction, in my opinion, is the area that has a band on the floor where you step on and it slowly moves you through a glass tunnel where you can see sharks and fish. It was so nice to see sharks, sting rays, eels (?? long fish that look like snakes), etc. It was very relaxing. Be careful stepping on it and off it. I was on my phone not paying attention and almost fell. It was pretty funny in fact. They have a variety of fish and sea creatures. I appreciate that they have their names in Spanish, English, and a few other languages. There is a cafe in there but we did not purchase anything from there. The restrooms were clean and had soap.

We ordered several items and truly loved all of them. We did order the lazy peppers and padron peppers, and these items were good, they were just not exciting as the other dishes.The service was wonderful. There was never a long wait for any food.

The second floor is dedicated to collections of author-centered art, including ceramics, glassware, textile and such, displaying an amazingly wide selection. The first floor is all about design and its influence. The aspect of how it is able to make every day objects more useful, full of interesting ideas is something I always like to see more of.To sum up, I think that the entry fee to this small and hidden curiosity was 6 Euros really well spent.

A short drive later, we arrived at the launch site, where the majestic balloon was nearing its full, awe-inspiring stature.With hearts filled with excitement, we climbed into the basket, receiving a thorough safety briefing from our experienced pilot. As the balloon gracefully lifted off the ground, we were enveloped by a sense of serenity, the hustle and bustle of the city melting away beneath us.The panoramic views of the city below unfolded like a breathtaking tapestry, revealing iconic landmarks and verdant landscapes bathed in the warm glow of the rising sun.

Located part way up the hilltop that culminates at the Castell de Montju\u00efc fort, the Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3 was one of the museums I wanted to visit in Barcelona since becoming mildly familiar via art history class of the art of both him and American artist Alexander Calder. (Both are distinguished as key figures in 20th century modern art especially Surrealism and the two artists were friends and contemporaries, serendipitously with similar artistic developments and themes even while being located an ocean apart.) Some of their works have been displayed at a number of world class art institutions which I've previously had the fortune of visiting, so to find out Mir\u00f3 had a dedicated museum here felt like a good enough reason to go check it out.The museum is reachable by foot, though it's faster via public bus #150 which loops around from the Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya traffic circle, which also goes up to the fort. The bus stop is directly outside of the museum, and the hop on hop off tourist bus also stops here. Upon arriving I came by foot the back way up stairs from the park behind it, so was able to admire a few of the outdoor sculptures on the museum grounds before looping around to the front. The white-washed color and unconventional shapes of the architecture immediately grab your attention and piqued my curiosity as to the exhibits inside. Inside the line for the ticket counter was quite short for a Saturday afternoon in September, it took 5 minutes to pay for tickets, then store my bag in a locker (free though you need a one-euro coin to trigger the lock mechanism which is returned after you unlock the locker). Tickets are \u20ac15 for adults, and \u20ac9 for students, seniors and any other guests that meet the reduced rate requirements. The exhibitions move in chronological order showcasing the evolution of Mir\u00f3's works, and they've done an excellent job making sure all descriptions throughout the museum are translated to Catalan, English and French. What intrigued me the most was the transition between mediums, I hadn't realized Mir\u00f3 had explored so many! He created sketches, paintings, sculpture in ceramic and metal/wood work, knit/woven tapestries.Aside from the exhibits of Mir\u00f3's works, the museum is a foundation that promotes modern art thru academic and educational programs, art research and also hosts exhibits from other 20th and 21st century artists. There is a museum store, cafe and bathrooms available on site. It takes 1-2 hours (closer to 1hr for me) to go thru the museum, it's two stories including access to several rooftop sculptures.

When I asked all my friends and many acquaintances about Barcelona, I could tell how old they were when they visited. Many were young when they came here so they would tell me, \"oh just walk around, that's what we did and it was great.\"  That tells me they went to Barcelona to party, which they did all night then slept until early afternoon and stumbled around with hangovers until it was time for a late dinner and another all night escapade of debauchery.  Well that's one kind of Barcelona visit.  The other kind makes the Miro museum a priority because this is one of the best art museums in the world.  It's set up to be educational, it's arranged to be whimsical, it's designed so that the architecture is the perfect place for this very strange art.  Fear no art.  Good cafe, excellent gift shop where I got some Miro espresso cups and saucers for my breakfast rotation back home.  Take the funicular up and then walk through the gardens to get here, afterwards climb up to the Catalan art museum and then the fort.  Take the bus down.  It will be a long day on your feet so wear comfortable but sturdy shoes.  If you're coming to Barcelona, I think the more research you do before you get here, the more you'll get out of the visit.

Mummies are people stolen from their resting places, not attractions, and the other artifacts should be the property of the people from whom they were stolen.

The museum contains several hundred artefacts, mostly of high quality, which are beautifully presented and generally well curated, with explanations in Catalan, Spanish and English. Although lacking the large architectural exhibits found in some of the world's major museums, there is plenty to provide a couple of hours' interest. The collection is particularly strong in the lesser-known late period, when Egypt was effectively part of the Greek and Roman empires. Items are grouped firstly by function - daily living, funeral rites, religious ritual, and so on - and then roughly chronologically. They include a small collection of mummies alongside the storage jars for mummified organs; an impressive (and very modern-looking) bed; tablets and wall painting fragments from tombs; preserved papyrus and textiles; jewellery, stoneware, ceramics and other daily objects; and a huge quantity of small figurines and votive statuary. A speciality of the museum is its regular evening dramatisations of life in ancient Egypt, such as funeral rites, and the life of Cleopatra and Ramses II (Spanish and Catalan only) for which separate fees and openings are organised (2011 price: EUR20). The museum has a small shop selling Egyptian-related items, toilets and a rooftop cafeteria, although it is not clear when this is open. A lift provides step-free access within the three floors museum. The collection isn't really one for younger children, unless they have a particular fascination for Ancient Egypt, though the shop has lots of items to cater for them. The main downer is the price: entry is a bit steep at EUR11 (EUR8 concessions - 2011), but we got in on a January Monday when it was half price entry.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Feb 3, 2011"}], "reviews_count": "9"}

Additionally, it is necessary to register each day you visit the casino, adhering to the casino's policies.The lower level, known as the beach floor, is where the live table games are located.

Open from 9 AM to 5 AM on Sunday through Thursday, with extended hours until 6 AM on Fridays, Saturdays, and holiday eves; this section caters to those who prefer machine-based gaming. The absence of traditional chips is noteworthy, as bets are placed directly using the machines.

Unfortunately, the Fat Tire tour in Barcelona paled in comparison with the Paris tour. Our morning tour on Saturday, January 23rd met at the Pla\u00e7a Sant Jaume. We were told to meet at the side of the plaza closest to Las Ramblas, but since we were unfamiliar with the area it took us a while to locate the exact meeting spot. The Fat Tire website claimed the guides would be wearing Fat Tire shirts and carrying a sign. There was no sign and if the guides were wearing Fat Tire shirts we could not see them under their jackets. There were two other bike tours meeting in the same plaza that morning so it would be helpful if they brought a sign in the future. We didn't receive the warmest welcome from the Fat Tire tour guides. Once they acknowledged that we were there for the bike tour they turned their backs to us and continued to talk among themselves while we awkwardly stood around. Luckily, once the bike tour started our tour  guide ended up be very cool and friendly. I forgot her name, but I remember she was from Holland. I was surprised how worn out the bikes were at the Fat Tire bike shop. Initially, I was offered a bike that was missing the front part of the seat! They seemed reluctant to switch out my bike even after I pointed out the missing chunk of the seat. Who wants to bike on cobble stone and unpaved paths with a broken bike seat?!?! My replacement bike wasn't much better. My bike's kickstand was broken so I had to lean my bike against bushes and walls during each stop of the tour. My sister's bell was broken on her bike so I had to ring my bell for her when unaware pedestrians stepped in front of her bike. About thirty minutes into our tour, my husband's tire went flat. Luckily, two guys from our group knew how to change a tire and had the bike fixed in about 20 minutes, but you could tell everyone was annoyed that we had to pause the tour to fix his bike.Foodies: prepare to be disappointed! On the Paris Fat Tire tour we stopped for an ice cream cone at Berthillon, one of the best ice cream shops in Paris. On the Barcelona tour we stopped at an overpriced tourist trap on the beach that had terrible food. Barcelona has so many amazing restaurants so I can't understand why Fat Tire couldn't have picked a better lunch spot. A \"locals only\" tapas bar or a cute churros shop would have been a better idea. It's apparent why the Fat Tire bikes are in terrible condition. At the end of the tour, the bikes were simply lined up in the shop and none of them were inspected for issues. We had to remind the shop to put my husband's bike with the spare tire to the side so that the bike tire could be replaced.Overall, the bike tour was fun, but our bikes and lunch were awful.

Make sure you put Spa!). We thought about going to the Hotel W but they were across town and really pricy. We asked our concierge at our hotel (Royal Ramblas) and they suggest Rambla 130 and it was directly across the street! We simply walked over there to make our appointment. It wasn't so easy to find, not a lot of signage, but we had the right address and someone in the building told us it was on the 3rd floor. The nice girl that spoke some english made our reservations and fit us in that afternoon. We were thrilled. They have all kinds of services, several massages incuding reflexology to choose from and also they do facials, manicures, pedicures. The don't have the hot tubs and saunas and that whole experience that full blown spas have (at least I don't think so, I did note someone showering there) but their massage services were really good and we didn't have all day anyway. I was really wanting a deep tissue massage (they called that an \"osteo\" massage) and my friend wanted a softer massage. The prices were great-the osteo was $60 an hour and a regular massage was $50. The W Hotel was way pricier than that, about 3 times as much. To my disappointment they got us mixed up (I think there was a lack of communication) and I got the softer massage. But maybe it all worked out because my friend ended up needing some more intensity and my person, her name was Ava, did such a great job with me. She did an all over massage, versus just focusing on the hurting areas, so I think we both ended up getting what we needed. I would give Ava 5 stars. My friend had a guy give her massage and I know she was really happy with him too. I wish we had time to try their different services. A pedicure or facial looked so enticing but we were short on time. Loved the atmosphere of the place, modern and calming.

Came here on the recommendation of fellow travelers. They said the food was delicious and it was very close to our hotel near the Place d'Espanya, so we gave it a try. Absolutely awesome! My friend and I ordered the mixed paella for two (18 Euros per person) and it probably could've fed four! It was chock full of different types of seafood and chicken chunks. The whole dish was flavorful and satisfied like a warm blanket on a freezing night! The young lady waitperson was so friendly and we laughed as we tried to communicate with each other (she with no English and me with no Spanish). After we were stuffed to the gills, she brought us a complimentary plate of 4 pieces of olive oil cake and two glasses of a very tart brightly colored yellow liqueur that my friend said had a definite kick. When I told our waitperson that I don't drink alcohol, she brought me a glass of the same fruity base liquid sans the alcohol, which I found to be very tart and very pleasing on the palate! When I finished it, the young lady offered me more, but there was no way for me to fit anything else into my completely full satisfied belly! This place might look touristy with the menu posted at the door and its plastic covered menu inside, but the food and staff are wonderful. Don't let your prejudices keep you from enoying the amazing place.

The host had a very high vehicle and it was very difficult to get in and out because I am only five feet tall. I hurt my shoulder and wound up going to the hospital after our return to the apartment. I paid  around five hundred dollars for the hospital visit and medicines. The owner of Barcelona Slow Travel said he was sorry. I said they need to make sure there is a step stool to aid short people. We also had a second tour booked with Slow Travel. Their experiences are very expensive and I truly hoped I would be offered my second trip as a token of concern for the expenses I incurred and my loss of vacation days and pain. Nothing was offered. Our second trip we had to take a taxi to and from the experience . For the high price, taxi should have been included. We made four stops on the Gourmet Wine and Food tour. The cheese store was not good.Think twice before booking with them.", "rating": "3", "visited": "Oct 27, 2022"}, {"review": "Our cooking class was an outstanding culinary experience!

My wife and I enjoyed the evening with a couple of dear friends from the UK, along with a couple of their friends, a young couple from Alabama and another couple from Sweden... and our hosts from Barcelona. 10 courses, with ample wine. Not only did we learn the secret of how to eat garlic without painful side effects (those of you \"our\" age will know what I mean) but I also went back for seconds on mussels. (A first for me.) ...and thirds! Wait... what? Some of the food that I have only tolerated in the past? I couldn't get enough of it! And my favorite gazpacho? Fuggedaboudit! ...and they promised to share their recipe for their mojito ice cream. JUST WAIT. You'll love it! Photos to follow...\"That's how I posted to FB upon getting home from our experience at Barcelona Slow Travel.  I was eager to share that to give a sense of enthusiasm that I had for that evening!  Our hosts, Christina and Guillermo, were warm, friendly, funny and eager to please.  While some of the treats on their menu were not a surprise (olive plate, gherkins and pickled garlic, and gazpacho) the rest of the evening's menu was entirely dependent on what Guillermo could find FRESH at the market that morning.  ...and FRESH made all the difference.Their space is intimate and inviting.  After getting to know each other for a bit, each of the guests were seated around a large butcher block table and given a cutting board and a sharp knife, along with a task - from zesting limes to veining garlic to prepping mushrooms, mussels, peppers and the rest, they put us to work!  Guillermo ensured that each guest was performing their task just right, while giving us the background of the dishes we were preparing, making small talk and generally making everyone feel \"at home.\"  Frankly, the next several hours passed by in a blur.  No, it wasn't the wine (okay, maybe just a little bit) but it was the pleasure of the company, the work involved, and the gastronomy!  The evening was a resounding SUCCESS.  I would not hesitate to return there.  (In fact, one of our group was there for her second time!)

After extensively researching private experiences in Barcelona we chose Barcelona Slow Travel, and we are so happy we did! We ended up booking two experiences- The farm to table and the Gourmet Food tour.  From the beginning we knew we chose well...emails were responded to quickly, communication was great, booking was easy! Guillermo was a great in providing some assistance and educating us of local festivities that were happening at the time of our visit, and making recommendations of some of their favorite restaurants.   We got a chance to meet and tour with both owners, Guillermo and Cristina with the two different experiences. Guillermo guided us on our Farm to table experience which started out by meeting the local farmers, harvesting our fresh vegetables, learned about the wonderful people and how they farmed the land in that area. We then went to the most beautiful country farmhouse which was also our \"cooking class\". We could never of imagined how much of a great time we'd end up having had laughing, drinking, learning, cooking and eating as we did on that perfect day! We learned from Guillermo how to make authentic Catalan dishes that not only  looked amazing, but were truly delicious especially with the spanish wines he had selected to enjoy with our meal! We will remember this day forever!   Our Gourmet food tour was amazing as well as this time, Cristina was our guide as she showed us around a few different neighborhoods in Barcelona.  We learned a lot about the history of the areas we walked through, she taught us about the history of the traditional food and drinks as we got to enjoy them! All of the artisanal  cheeses, local wines, traditional drinks, authentic tapas we had that evening were amazing! We ended our evening at a \"favorite\" restaurant of theirs to be greeted by a sweet lady who was one of the owners. We were also surprised by a special guest who joined us for dinner, Guillermo! Needless to say, we had the most a wonderful experiences with both Guillermo and Cristina whom we are so grateful to have had met on our trip to Barcelona!

My disappointment has to do with their business practice.  We had a cruise scheduled that was stopping in Barcelona on Monday, April 13.  We booked a food tour with Barcelona Slow Travel at the cost of EUR 500, and I put down a deposit of EUR 250.  Because of the Coronavirus, the cruise line decided to cancel the Barcelona stop on April 13.  At about the same time, we decided to cancel our trip and asked Barcelona Slow Travel for a refund.  Their response was, \"If the cancellation is made more than 15 days before the beginning of the experience, 80% of the total price of the experience will be refunded to the customer by Barcelona Slow.\"  The cancelation fee was EUR 100, making the refund EUR 150.  As it turns out, Spain imposed a nationwide lockdown around March 14.  Because of this, Barcelona Slow Travel would not have been able to provide us with the tour.

The food was very enjoyable, especially because we sourced the food from the local market and make it as a group.This is our first time to Barcelona.

Chef Victor, Christina and Guillermo took great pride to select a menu that represented the most fresh seasonal foods straight from the market and local suppliers.  We also sampled food that isn't even offered in our respective countries.  They were super respectful of my friend's (severe) food allergy, and with absolutely no fuss, simply plated his serving before adding seafood to entrees for the rest of us. Christina and Guillermo have made so many connections through their gastronomy research, they've expanded into tours as well. It was a unique experience, we were allowed to \"help\" with preparations, and a of course had great conversation with like-minded people.

While I've been cooking all my adulthood they still had tips to share with me that I'm delighted to know.  And our meal had all fresh organic ingredients that are locally sourced.  We love Barcelona and now we love it even more.  We arrived at 6pm by the 59 bus from Barceloneta - easy and straight there.  And we left at about 11:30 pm and went home by the metro (two blocks away) safely and easily.  There are still lots of folks about since this is a night time city and it doesn't get dark in the summer until after 10pm.  Between those two times, the time flew.  I loved that we participated in the cooking but there was no pressure to do it 'right.'  My husband has never cooked but loved taking part in the dicing, shucking and peeling adventures.  Each course was yummy and it all was accompanied by different wines.  And since it was a hot summer evening the menu was lighter fare - mussels, cod, gazpacho, Mojito sorbet and much more that I don't remember the names of right now - especially the cheeses and sausages.  Guillermo and Cristina and fabulous at helping people feel relaxed and playful so the 10 of us thoroughly enjoyed meeting each other, too.  And since their English is great, I didn't feel uncomfortable with my lack of Spanish.Go prepared to eat well, have fun, and learn something about the food and culture of Barcelona and Catalunya.

Hear me out.. It was actually tasty and not overbearingly sour like a thousand warheads striking down upon me. I was so intrigued by it, the opportunity had to be taken. It's an uncommon flavor pair that has a mild intake followed by a sour bit layered with coffee. I would get it again. Overall the place is nice with outstanding service.

This place is the highest in price that we've seen in the area....Diner beware!!", "rating": "1", "visited": "Sep 18, 2024"}, {"review": "Came here laat week.  Service was very good.  Sangria excellent.  Found many of the tapas to be bland.  Sea bass was tasty.", "rating": "3", "visited": "Jun 27, 2024"}, {"review": "Came to this place quite by accident.  We were looking to get dinner and on that night most places were closed so it was quite a welcome sight to see.  There was live music playing on the patio (can't remember the gentleman's name now).The food was decent.  Nothing spectacular but well prepared and tasty.  Ordered Pimientos de Padron, Pulpo, Patatas Bravas, something else, which I can't remember now, but we have enjoyed it immensely.  The dishes are simple and were well made.  Service was good but not spectacular but I think they can improve.  Overall I would say a good place to visit.", "rating": "4", "visited": "May 15, 2022"}, {"review": "We went to this place since it was just by our hotel... and wish we had come sooner. Service was great and fast, outdoor seating had a great vibe, and food was incredible - I had the original paella and my husband the ribeye. We also had two tapas before dinner. Prices were not bad for steak and seafood and finally a place where we were not treated differently for being tourists. Strongly recommend!", "rating": "5", "visited": "Apr 8, 2023"}, {"review": "Ducked into this place while in the waiting list for a famed corner restaurant.  The friendly bartender not only showed us how he listened but how much of a craftsmen he was. We returned to experience the same attention todetail with excellent tapas to match.  When your bartender whips out the torch you know you're in the right place!  Bellies are happy and we're onto the night's activities.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Dec 17, 2018"}, {"review": "Very good spot.  The food is solid and the price is great for quality and ambiance.  They spent a ton of money on buildout and did it first class.  The DJ spins great tunes and atmosphere is fun and solid energy.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Aug 3, 2018"}, {"review": "Four stars for the food (typical tapas but very good) but knocked down to a three for the service.  Our waiter ignored us after taking an initial order, which took him too long, and we were only saved by another waiter who did notice our plight.  Maybe our first guy didn't like our Spanish skills, or he just liked hanging around the bar chatting to others.Nice looking modern feel.", "rating": "3", "visited": "May 14, 2019"}, {"review": "Tapas everywhere and worth stopping for when your in the area. Shopping on the Rambla makes you hungry. Not impressed with the wine by the glass as we tried both red offerings. The potato bravas was good as was the iberico on toast. I would look at a bottle of the better wine", "rating": "4", "visited": "May 29, 2019"}, {"review": "This place is pretty on point, great food and excellent drinks.

Found this place after picking up the gay map from one of the gay bars in the area. We found that the staff are really friendly, although they didn't speak English they were pleasant and gave us free crisps n Bombay mix. Drink prices are cheap enough. Great atmosphere and decent music.
