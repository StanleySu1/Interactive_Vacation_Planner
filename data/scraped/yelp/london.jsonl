Since we were visiting, we were most interested in items we could enjoy then and there.During peak hours you can be shoulder to shoulder with others, and even during quieter hours it's crowded. Being able to set up a meeting spot and then divide and conquer with ordering items is a good plan.There were times where my husband and I would order and I would wait for the food to be ready while he headed off to another booth to order something.Be ready to stand and eat as there are very few places to sit, but it's mostly street food and is easy to walk and enjoy.I wish we had more time to explore while we were here, because everything we tried was delicious.

They've got the Rosetta Stone. It's a big hunk of rock and SO MANY PEOPLE take selfies with it. (shrug)  It is strategically placed so that it is easy to locate on the main floor of the museum. Entry to this museum is FREE with a suggested donation of \u00a35 (less than $10 US). I'll say that again: FREE access to all of this great stuff. I suggest hitting their website to check the hours and request a ticket for a specific time. I think they may limit the number of people in the building, so having that free reservation is a good idea. Also, it speeds entry since you just have them scan the QR code. I believe there are special exhibits that do require payment, but there is so much here that you don't need to do that, especially on your first visit, unless it is something you're REALLY into seeing. The gift shop takes up most of the center of the main floor. It is a big shop with plenty of souvenirs and even more books. This is a research museum and some items were listed as having been temporarily removed for research purposes. If you're into ancient Egypt, this is pretty much a must-go place. However, they have expansive collections of so many other parts of the world, too: there's an informative and beautiful section on Mayan artifacts and culture, for example. The section of Japanese artifacts was really well done: not cramped and with plenty of descriptions. I learned a lot. The place is huge and I recommend downloading the map or b purchasing one at the entrance for ... I think it was \u00a33. If you download their audio app ahead of time, you can preload the overview audio files -- though I found the main areas too crowded and loud for my Shockz headset to be of any use. Don't miss \"Room 1,\" on the main floor. This is intended to represent a museum during the Enlightenment period and looks like you'd think an old museum/research library would look, but with less dust. The room was originally built to house the library of King George III and is beautiful. I was a little bummed that the map said Room 3 (a variable exhibit) had the \"Asahi Shimbun Displays\" but actually had no real exhibit during our visit. They have cafes, a restaurant, and a pizza restaurant onsite and out front, but within the museum grounds, there was a coffee truck/trailer with some tables and chairs.

Enjoy the shared fruits of humanity and appreciate the spirit of human creativity and ingenuity. It's here, so celebrate it. I recommend to come ready with a plan of what your highest priority galleries will be, because there's just so much. There are droves of people and there was no perceptible air conditioning.

Its treasures, which come from all around the world, include noteworthy pieces such as the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, and Egyptian mummies. These pieces provide unparalleled perspectives on ancient civilizations and their legacies. The museum's strength is its ability to demonstrate the interconnectivity of human history using artifacts from diverse cultures. The displays are thematically organized, ranging from Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome to Asian, African, and Indigenous cultures. The Great Court, with its spectacular glass roof, is an architectural masterpiece that enhances the museum-going experience. The Egyptian galleries were one of my favorite exhibits to see; the mummies are one of the most recognized and prominent elements of the gallery, and it was fascinating to learn about ancient Egyptian beliefs in the afterlife and intricate burial techniques. The collection included approximately 120 human mummies as well as several animal mummies, making it one of the world's most significant collections of its type.The museum's gift shop offers a diverse selection of one-of-a-kind and culturally inspired items for history lovers and tourists. It is located near the museum's entrance and exit, the shop allows visitors to take home a bit of their experience, with souvenirs reflecting the museum's diverse collections. One of the shop's standout features is its collection of imitation antiquities inspired by legendary treasures like the Rosetta Stone, Egyptian mummies, and the Parthenon Marbles. The replicas range from small trinkets to bigger ornamental pieces, giving you the opportunity to possess a piece of history in miniature.

That was super weird and uncomfortable. It didn't feel at all like art. Otherwise, it's a cool museum. They also had the yoko ono exhibit but it wasn't free so I didn't check it out.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Jul 20, 2024"}, {"review": "I don't have anything brilliant to reveal about the Tate Modern except to say it's the ideal place to hang out when you're waiting for check-in at your hotel. Jamie W. and I were staying nearby at the Sea Containers London off the South Bank promenade. I've been to this museum several times but not Jamie, so we spent a couple of hours roaming the former Battersea Power Station. The massive Turbine Hall never fails to impress.It has gotten even bigger by over double the gallery space since my last visit with the addition of the twisted brick Blavatnik Building extension. The collection of modern art is extensive with 60,000 permanent works in constant rotation. All the greats are represented though I have to say there isn't really a singular signature piece that defines the museum other than the architecture itself. But who can complain when it's free?Yes, that always blows me away given the breadth of work presented here. They do charge for special exhibitions, so out of curiosity, we paid \u00a322 to see \"Yoko Ono: Music of the Mind\", quite an expansive hodgepodge of film, music, poetry, photography, and participatory art where we could leave our own mark on an art piece. Well, it was better than we thought it would be, but thank God, we just got a message our room was ready. Oh, I forgot to mention the slow elevators.RELATED - Exploring London?

Being that we love to visit museums during our travels, this was music to our ears. Ironically, a cousin of mine who resides in London, suggested that we visit the Tate Modern museum. Therefore, on our third day of being in London, we ventured to the Tate Modern.Upon arrival, we were enamored by the open space, simplistic architectural design of the museum. When entering each exhibit, you're greeted by thorough details of what you're viewing and supporting artifacts (like most museums). Since we were visiting during traditional work & school hours, the museum was not terribly busy. Therefore, we did not feel rushed when reading descriptions and viewing the various modes of artifacts. Like many museums, sometimes the amount of exhibits can be overwhelming (not complaining). However, there were a number of inclusive exhibits that really stood out to us. One being the Nikita Gale light show that focused on Tina Turner's Private Dancer. Second being the exhibits that highlighted the work, struggles, and sometimes murder of individuals that identify as  LGBTQ+. We also fancied the Guerrilla Girls exhibit that brought attention to the discrimination faced by women and people of color. Unfortunately, four floors of the museum were closed (more than likely due to the construction of new exhibits) during our visit.

The Tate Modern architecture (outside and especially the great hall inside) continues to impress in an \"Oh Wow!), sort of way.2.  We were underwhelmed by the gift shops, of which we perhaps expected more of a production like the Museum of Modern Art in NYC. 3.  There is no admission charge, which allowed us to wonder through some pretty interesting exhibits.  BUT:4.  The special exhibitions cost money and they are priced individually.

Both of these were signs that it was time to leave and I'm glad I did as the whole area begins to feel like something not for someone of my age the later in the day it gets.But earlier?  No lie.

Not even really sure what we were trying but hey it's free I'm not gonna say no. The chicken we tried was very good so I looked at the booth it had come from that being Cheesy Naan Melts. Cheesy Naan Melts was a concept I had never heard of but once looking it over it sounded amazing. Think of a Grilled Cheese but on Naan with Middle Eastern seasoned meats and sauces (I think more specifically Pakistani). I had to get something from here because again I had very seen or heard of anything like it. I went with the Lamb Shish Kebab Naan Melt and got the spicy sauce with it. Within 10 minutes my food was ready and it was amazing. The Naan was crispy but still soft loaded with cheese and lamb and the lamb was so tender and flavorful too with just the right amount of spicy to it too. I know it's not really a Grilled Cheese but I don't have much to compare it too. I will say it's for sure top 3 Grilled Cheese I have ever had though. Mine was so good that Ashley then went and got one and my parents got 2. I also got to try Ashley's Masala Chicken Naan Melt and she got Masala Fries too.

The dinosaur exhibit is particularly impressive, with a towering T-Rex model that captivates both youngsters and adults. The interactive displays and multimedia features make the learning experience enjoyable for all ages. One of the most memorable experiences was wandering through the dinosaur gallery.

Yes, there is a significantly less people in the early morning but it doesn't matter when it's raining so hard that you can barely make out Big Ben in the background.

There is also a very nice market with food items and pastries such as the Victoria sponge and my favorite the Bakewell Tarts.The domed vaulted ceilings provide a striking entry from one room to the next, radiating a definite  feeling of grandeur when you walk around this splendid art gallery.

This building holds countless masterful art works including my favorites - Monet, Titian, Rembrandt, Seurat the dot, Van Gogh, Leonardo DaVinci, Van Dyck, Michaelangelo, Boticelli and so much more!

My wife and I visited in September 2024 and both of us were surprised by how interesting and enjoyable a visit the Abbey would be. The majesty of the building and its architecture, and its place in history need to be experienced.As a 60 yr old Londoner it shameful to say that I'd never been to the Abbey and dismissed it as another beautiful building. Having become really interested in British history in our later years, the Abbey now holds a greater fascination. Kings and Queens of all periods, among other notable historical characters, are laid to rest here.The building is 1000 years old and that is a lot of history. The audio tour is exceptional, well worth the time to learn about the many details and stories of the nobles.We took the The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries in as well, and this is easily overlooked museum. Absolutely worth the small entry fee, but leave yourself and extra hour or two to walk around the exhibits. Incredible look into the Royal past with many artefacts, costumes, weapons.We bought tickets ahead of time and lines were still very long. We expected September with kids back in school would be much less busy. Wrong. Every other couple now unencumbered by children seemed to have the same idea. The place was PACKED which made it exhausting. Dodging crowds is our least favourite thing.There is a verger guided tour that gets you access to some otherwise hidden parts of the grounds. We didnt do this as it is another 90 minutes, but next time we will certainly do it.We took in libations at the Cloisters Cafe, which was okay. Food was actually pretty good but predictably overpriced. We didnt have the energy to go hunting after many hours on our feet, and heads full of names and dates. We were thankful it was there.Westminster Abbey is one of many incredible historical buildings in London, but this one is well worth the time explore and learn, especially if you have any interest in the real figures and stories you may have seen portrayed in shows like The White Princess, The White Queen, The Tudors et al.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Oct 30, 2024"}, {"review": "If you're a tourist trying to squeeze in all the sights in London and wondering if you should keep Westminster Abbey on your list, I'm here to tell you that YES!

Yes, they got beautiful frescos, amazing sculptures, mosaic tiles floors, and impressive architecture, but Westminster Abbey has all that and so much more. I've always been fascinated with the history of Mary Queen of Scots and Queen Elizabeth I. So needless to say it was quite an amazing experience being able to visit their actual tombs up close and be in the same room as the bodies of such amazing and impactful women. The amount of historic leaders that are buried in this Abby is very impressive. Not to mention all of the artists, actors, poets, and other culturally important figures. The Abby itself is massive, but the tour ensures that you won't miss a single bit of it. They provide you with a free audio guide, and corral you along like cattle through the entire building. Don't forget to purchase your separate tickets to see the queens jubilee Gallery, which includes a ton of effigies, outfits that monarchs actually wore, as well as several other important and impressive historical items, including Prince William, and Princess Kate's wedding certificate.I would visit Westminster Abbey again in a heartbeat, and in fact, would love to go back and be able to spend more time.

Both studio tours are very pretty similar, with the Tokyo location being larger and having more interactive stuff, etc, since understandably that location is newer. But the London studio is the actual location where the films were made! When looking to buy tickets for the studio tour in London, tickets were sold out on WB's website for the dates we wanted. And we looked about 2 months in advance! Thankfully, there is a sightseeing and ticket company in London, Golden Tours that sold tickets and provided transportation to and from the WB Studio, which was even better! The studio was located in Leavesden, about 20+ miles outside of the city of London, and there was no way for us to get there via public transportation. Depending on which time slot you book for the tour, it could take 45 to 90 mins to get to and from Leavesden by the Golden Tour's charter bus. On the way, they played Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone movie for us to hype us up for the studio tour. Everything was very well organized. We were very pleased with Golden Tours company. There is no restroom on the bus if I recall correctly, so make sure to use the restroom before you get on the bus if you need to. Anyway, we got to the WB studio, and it was just the best. Memories of watching all the Harry Potter movies came flooding back. It was so nostalgic for anyone who grew up reading the books and watching the movies.Seeing the actual props and walking through the sets in person, having seen them in the movies, was so exciting! Some of the sets even included 4D effects as well, which was really fun. We saw lots of behind the scenes work and how props and sets were made. Watching the movies, you always think, how do they make these magical scenes work? There were also lots of staff members on site, ready to answer your questions, and help you take photos. Everyone was super nice.Of course, no trip to any Harry Potter attraction is complete without a butter beer! My husband and I savored our butter beers in the courtyard overlooking the Dursleys' residence, the Weasleys' residence, Herbology greenhouse, Knight Bus, and the Covered Bridge. These are all accessible except for the Weasley's home since it was not built to scale. Other accessible sets include the Great Hall, Dumbledore's office, the Forbidden Forest, Gringotts Bank, Hogsmeade Village, among many others. Other sets, though not accessible, can be appreciated from behind a rope or barrier.  After finishing our butter beers and taking photos with every single set in the courtyard, we continued our tour that eventually led us to THE Hogwarts Castle that was used whenever they needed a shot of the entire castle. FYI, the castle was not built to scale, but it was still really, really large and super cool. There was soooo much to see. 3 hours never flew by so quickly. In the 3 hours we were there, we still managed to do some shopping in the gift shop and grab food at the cafeteria. Overall, it was totally worth it.

I remember reading the books growing up and I remember when the books were being released in bookstores and how big of a deal it was. I had loved every single one of those books ever since and when the movies came along it just blew my mind away at how amazing they turned out. I had no idea how they made them so as I got older i realized this studio excisted. When I finally had adult money and time to travel I told myself one day I would visit England and see all those wonderful places and things I saw in the HP movies. Well I finally had that chance on March 2023. This was my #1 thing to do while staying in London and I do not regret it. LOVED IT!!! I absolutely loved all of it! This is the best thing you could do as a HP fan. If you have a HP fan in the family bring them here and it will make their year! I loved it so much I wanna go back again as soon as I can. I originally was gonna purchase tickets directly from then and go ono my own thru public transportation. I keep checking the website and there were lots of availability during my trip so I got  carried away and forgot to buy my ticket. 2 weeks before my trip all ticket and time slots were sold out. I was so heartbroken but I had a back up plan to go and book with Golden tours as recommended by the studios site. Golden tours provided transportation to and from the studio and admission.

Please Please book your tickets in advance!!!!I suggest coming here as early as possible to avoid as many of the crowds as possible. One thing i did not know but glad it was available was a bag storage. When you go to check in they kind of go over everything you need and they give you a passport to stamp as you make your way through the exhibit. There is a counter where they asked me if I would like to leave my backpack with them and I am glad I did because it made my trip through the studio so much lighter. I took the self guided tour so I was able to go at my own pace and take my time. Absolutely loved every minute of it. The staff here was amazing!

There are so many positives: you could spend days in here and still not see everything. My family spent over 4 hours before we were exhausted enough to head back to London. Everything is done so well: the sets are amazing, the details are impressive, the number of exhibits were mind boggling, and the employees were all true Harry Potter fans, which made us feel like we were at a big HP conference with like-minded people. The biggest negative was how busy it was. We went on a Sunday and arrived at 11am for a 12pm tour. We took a train to Watford Junction Station, then hopped on a themed bus that took us directly to the tour. But there were so many people that they all couldn't fit on the bus, and it took some 15 minutes for the next bus to arrive. During the tour itself, we queued up and it took about 45 minutes to actually start the proper tour, although admittedly they did a wonderful job of keeping everyone entertained while we were waiting (short movies to watch, different rooms that we queued through, fun and hilarious guides along the way, etc.). When we finally got to the main tour, there was so much to see (there were no more queues at this point, it was kind of a free for all), and often there were too many people in front of us at certain exhibits for us to want to line up again. But regardless, we had a great time and got to see almost everything we wanted to, despite the crowds. Some tips: the breakfast in the lunchroom before you start the tour was AMAZING and reasonably priced considering what we got. I'd recommend showing up early and giving it a try. Also, we ended up buying the audio tour devices, which I probably would not have done in hindsight; there was so much to see and do that I ended up not listening to the guides very much. They did have an interactive map on them, which was honestly the most useful. And if you're going to buy Butterbeer (there is another kitchen roughly halfway through the tour), there is a separate line just for Butterbeer, so you don't have to wait through the food line if you're not getting food. There is so much merchandise to purchase, and I believe a lot of it can only be found at the studio tour. So take your time when shopping because once you leave the tour, you can't go back in to purchase anything you missed. Oh, lastly, there are plenty of photo opportunities all around, but the nicest for us were the Platform 9 3/4 going-through-the-wall stations. For whatever reason, those were not too busy so we got done nice photos. This is helpful because if you're hoping to get a similar photo at the actual Kings Cross Station in London, there is bound to be a long line. It was nice already getting that photo at the studio tour. All in all, if you have a day to spare while in London, and if you're even a moderate Harry Potter fan, I highly recommend the Warner Bros Studio Tour.

Next to it is the candy hall with a panic-inducing variety of confectionery items for both eating and drinking. If you go farther in, you'll hit the hall with shelf-stable goods like honeys, biscuits, seasonings, coffees, and spices. There is also a coffee bar here with some of the best-tasting coffee I've ever had and a hefty variety of cakes, tarts, and sandwiches; as well as a queue that can go around the hall on some days.Finally, you have the dining hall, which is a collection of small \"restaurants\" that are really just bars surrounded by stools with a kitchen in the middle of each one.

As for the food, I'd say it was surprisingly just ok. The presentation is really nice. The chips are thick and crisp and the fish is a large piece. But they apparently use a gluten free breading, and so it gives it this weird, hard texture similar to fried cornmeal. The fish itself was also a bit dry.

Thankfully. I would not recommend doing otherwise.Being our first vacation without child, we expected all the kids to be back in school so attractions like the War Rooms would be practically empty. How wrong we were. Every other couple now without kids had the same idea as us, and the place (as was every attraction we visited this trip) was PACKED like sardines.This slightly took the edge off our enjoyment of the tour and museum as we were constantly tripping up and avoiding people. It was hard to get to see everything in the museum, and the audio tour felt rushed as the throng of visitors piled up behind us. We spent two hours here and most of that was dancing around other guests. For the price I don't feel this was overall good value.All that aside - it's an unavoidable side-affect of a hugely popular attriaction - the museum is a fascinating insight to the life and work of a man we all know by name, but whom I knew very little actual fact about. The War Rooms tour takes you back to that time, and paints a vivid picture of what it was like down in the bunker, and the sacrifice those working there made. The fact the rooms were left in the state they remain, as the day the war ended, tells us how quick (and no doubt happy) they all were to get out of that place.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Oct 30, 2024"}, {"review": "During our recent stay in London, one of the highlights was visiting the Churchill War Rooms.  This was where Winston Churchill (who later was Queen Elizabeth's 1st Prime Minister) and his staff directed their WW2 efforts from this subterranean bunker. Hundreds of people served in this underground command center over the course of 6 years.  We saw and were fascinated by the map room, Churchill's phone hot line room (disguised a bathroom), his bedroom, and many other spaces (largely untouched) that helped the Allies win the war.  Helpful Docents were readily available to tell stories and help fill in some blanks. From the street, the entrance to the Churchill War Rooms is rather plain, which even today speaks to the hidden nature of this place.

Instead of a logical layout, it takes you through a  maze of Churchill artifacts that are (loosely) grouped by time period--starting with WW2. Instead of laid out in the form of a story, you bounce from one exhibit to the next without truly grasping the decades of service this great man gave to his country.

The Churchill Museum was neatly detailed and covers everything from his early life, political experience, relations with other leaders, writings and speeches, and of course the role he played in WWII and why exactly the War Rooms were such an important site. However, the cost of this detail was the maze-like layout and disorganization of the exhibit. It is very easy to miss parts, and the chronology of information is not the best. I'll still maintain that if you come here to learn a lot, you will.I felt that the audio tour, while free, was intended for a more younger audience. There were signs indicating which recording to press, but sometimes I skipped over it because I knew I'd get more utility out of reading the panels. My favorite part was the Map Room and seeing all the living quarters (especially Churchill's) which gave me a glimpse into what the \"War Rooms experience\" was like.

This was unlike any amusement park we went to. We ordered our tickets online and chose the rides and activities we wanted to visit. While entering, we were instantly blown away by how everything was arranged. There were so many cute gift shops and food carts. The Ice Kingdom was amazing and had immersive ice exhibits for us to check out. The sculptures looked incredible and so detailed. We were able to slide down an icy slide and stick a coin to an icy wall. There are lots of photo opportunities as well. We also went on the Ferris Wheel which had an amazing view and circulated 3 times. We were getting a little dizzy from the rocking but it was still fun.

I had some mulled wine and chips, which were reasonably priced, but that was the only positive thing I have to say.There was plenty of seating in general, but there was also a lack of heated areas to warm up. We saw one bar that had heated seating advertised, but only in a very small section with 4 tables max. Music was a little strange, the live musicians were talented, but they weren't singing any Christmas songs.

This fair was near our hotel and I just knew I had to go! I took advantage of our first free time opportunity to go to Hyde Park Winter Wonderland and had an amazing time!! Figuring out how to book activities online was a little confusing, but it also showed me just how many rides and activities there are at Hyde Winter Wonderland.Due to costs, I only took part in one activity; the Ice Bar. Since I was alone, I was a bit awkward sitting with my drink by myself, so I would definitely recommend you go with friends to this attraction. However, the bar was so cool; I got one free drink in a cup made out of ice. The drink I chose was pink and cutesy and tasted amazing. The bar and its decor was made out of ice and had neon color-changing lights everywhere. There were ice sculptures and other interesting things to look at, and with the jacket and gloves you are loaned, it wasn't horribly cold. The one downside of this attraction is that it was a bit pricey, running at about 17 pounds. Besides that, it was awesome all around!Since the rides were cheaper than the attractions, I rode 4 rides at Hyde Winter Wonderland. They were The Hangover, Munich Looping, Blizzard, and Airborne. With each of these rides, I didn't experience a long wait at all. If you have gone to an American fair, you understand the pain of waiting in painfully long lines for rides. The lines at Hyde Winter Wonderland were extremely short in my opinion. I don't know if this can apply to everyday and for every activity, seeing as the ice skating rink was sold out, but it should be known that the lines for the attractions I did were VERY short, which really elevated my experience.What better ride to start with than The Hangover; Hyde Winter Wonderland's 279 foot (85 meter) drop tower? As we were raised to the top, the mechanism holding the seats rotated in a circle, giving us a beautiful view of more London from above than you can see from a stationary high place. Then we were dropped to the ground, giving me a rush of adrenaline!If you dislike drop towers, but love rollercoasters, then Munich Looping is the ride for you! Munich Looping is the world's largest portable roller coaster featuring 5 loops! I was very excited for this as I love colorful roller coasters with loops, and as soon as the ride started, we were already looping!! A very nice thing to note is that I didn't get whiplash, which I was very grateful for, as that is the main downside I have experienced riding looped coasters. The loops were thrilling and fun, and the colorfulness of the coaster was appealing to my eyes. It was extremely fun! I would definitely recommend this ride if you are starting to get into more high-adrenaline rides.I am not one to be scared on rides that often since I have ridden many high thrill rides, but Airborne had me so scared I was gripping the over the shoulder restraint for dear life!! I haven't experienced this level of fear on a ride in FOREVER, so if you are an adrenaline junkie, Airborne will definitely give you your fix! Airborne is a pendulum ride that offers you no visibility of itself as you are soaring through the air in circles reaching 213 feet (65 meters) high. It feels as if you are in free fall, offering an incredible view of London upside-down!! The fact that all I could see was my environment and not the ride was the scariest part as it felt like I was going to fall face first into the ground far below. It was awesome!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys thrill rides.The last ride I did at Hyde Winter Wonderland was Blizzard; a pendulum ride that is very similar to Airborne, but just as fun! This ride also stands at 213 feet (65 meters) tall, but was not as scary since you could see the ride during each rotation. The bright and vibrant color-changing lights made this ride so pretty, which I loved. While this ride is not as scary as Airborne, it will definitely still give you a major adrenaline rush. My adrenaline was already peaked by riding Airborne before this, so this ride felt more relaxing, which was very enjoyable. Airborne lacked Blizzard's visual element of the beautiful lights, which I enjoyed very much. With all this being said, if you are looking for some adrenaline but also to feel relaxed at the same time, Blizzard is the ride for you!There are over 100 rides and attractions to experience at Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, and I had a blast only experiencing 5! Hyde Park Winter Wonderland was my favorite activity I experienced in London, and that speaks volumes! I love thrill rides, but there were plenty of other attractions for individuals of all ages.

The food options literally left my jaw dropped, and the same will happen to your Instagram followers.

It feels very much like a hip/up and coming area, which celebrates inclusivity. The market itself is wonderful! Even midday on the weekend, it was much less busy than some of the more popular/tourist markets in London. The food!! So much variety with interesting local and international flavors. Really something for everyone. And the wares were actually good and shoppable. I really liked the colors and quality of the clothing, pottery, accessories etc that I was seeing. Sometimes I feel like market wares are kind of just souvenir-ish or cheaper looking, but this is stuff I would actually shop and buy because I really like it, not just for the novelty of shopping a market. The streets along the market are adorned with cute cafes and shops as well. Dog friendly, bike friendly. And a fun little canal walk nearby. In terms of getting here from Central London - I found the most convenient way to get here was via city bus, and navigating that was super easy. I just found the best bus number and route via Google Maps (though I know there's a more accurate city app of some sort), and you can tap to pay when you board using credit card, Apple Pay etc. I boarded at London Bridge so there were a ton of people, but the tip if you're at a bus stop alone is to make sure to stick an arm out to indicate to the bus driver that you want to board so they stop. Then before getting to your stop, there's a \"stop\" button you can push from your seat to indicate you want the bus to stop so you can get off. And then just walk off.

It is THE market for ultimate food heaven.The market only runs on a Saturday, so best to get there early... which means more time to eat! It covers one whole street, and is surrounded by a mix of shops and cafes, so it is really easy to navigate through. I recently spent a morning at Broadway Market and loved every minute of it.Highlights:* Fine Fayre for Scottish Eggs - or soft boiled eggs, wrapped in sausage, covered in breadcrumbs and fried until crispy on the outside. Prior to this, I had never tried a Scotch egg and after spending a few days in Edinburgh, we couldn't go past their Haggis one. Served with mustard and chutney, it had lovely textures and flavours, in particular the runny yolk and outer crisp.* Deeny's for a Scottish sandwich - like your normal toasted sandwich, but one step more gourmet! We were very happy because the sandwiches are filled with their homemade haggis spread (already missing haggis now that I'm back in Auckland!). The sandwiches were also oozing with cheddar and melt in your mouth!* Meringue Girls - I was looking forward to trying a meringue from Meringue Girls, mainly because we don't really have anything like it in Auckland and also one of the co-owners is a Kiwi... so of course I had to try one! Their stand is very colourful, with rows and rows of beautifully presented meringues. They sell two varieties - their original 'Meringue Kisses' with flavours like passionfruit, chocolate, hazelnut and one called 'Unicorn Poop' and rounder meringues which come with an individual topping, like fresh fruit, shredded coconut and crushed pistachios. I chose a raspberry meringue, which was super cute and sweet!* Vegetable Stew from Creole Kitchen, serving French/Caribbean dishes. My Mum actually had this for lunch, but luckily I got a taste! Beautiful flavours and vegetables never tasted so good!* A Berliner (a German pastry similar to a doughnut) from Artisan Foods - my sweet treat after our Scottish eggs and haggis toasted sandwich. This was oozing with custard (one of my favourite things) and hit my sweet spot!Other things you will find:* All the fresh produce and there is lots of it. Stands selling apples, all kinds of berries, tomatoes in all shapes and colours and a vast selection of vegetables.*The array of sweet treats in general - think German fruit cheesecake, S S'mores chocolate cheesecake, French pastries, sweet tarts, strudels (like apple and cinnamon), epic looking fudge, bounty brownie, eclairs, vegan cakes and doughnuts. Seriously everything!*Savoury delights - olives, olives, olives, Ciabatta sandwiches (with fillings like salami and brie), ethnic dishes and salads, homemade pies, sausage rolls, rainbow bagels, falafel and Japanese katsu chicken.*CHEESE, CHEESE and more CHEESE. My latest obsession and there is one stand selling it all.As well as the vast array of foods, you will also find stallholders selling flowers, vintage items, clothing and coffee.  Other things I loved about Broadway Market is that there are dogs everywhere! Dogs AND Food meant one happy me. And there is street art too, and one mural (below) suited our rainy day particularly well.Some may say that Broadway Market is super busy, and I totally agree. But it is truly an amazing market.

Investigate its multicultural stalls to find everything from Taiwanese egg waffles to Ethiopian food to jams and breads. Compared to other markets, it is a little light on the produce/grocery items, so I would recommend it more as a stop for lunch than as a shopping trip. (for that consider broadway market in bethnal green). Here though there are numerous delights and I quite enjoy coming every week or two for a delicious toastie or Chinese pork bun. Prices are a little high, but generally ok (except one of the dumpling stands... \u00a35 for 3 dumplings? I would never!), and the feeling of the market is quite lively and fun.

We wanted to try every one but we settled on a classic Scotch Egg, and the Mix Combo from the Ethiopian booth.  Scotch Egg:  Even though the vendor re-fried it for a bit for us, it was still cold in the center.  Regardless of that fact, it was delicious!  The egg was perfectly soft boiled, and the sausage around it had a pleasing texture and flavor.  The coarse salt and pepper sprinkled in the halved pieces was a nice accent.  Ethiopian Food:The Mix Combo was utterly delicious!  It came with Doro and Sego Tibs (beef and chicken), Injera bread, and a choice of two sides.  Because we had never had Ethiopian cuisine before, the sweet lady who runs the booth gave us a small sampler of each of the vegetable sides. My favorite were the split yellow peas, cabbage, and spinach.  I was also fascinated by the Injera bread!  It was a tangy, fluffy, pancake / flatbread.  Soooo yummy!

We each had a couple of the drinks and really enjoyed them. The staff even comes around and mingles with you if you want.

I went through a period in the mid Noughties when I was a very infrequent visitor. However, I found that towards the middle of last year, as I realised a significant and what appears to be a sympathetic regeneration was underway, I was being drawn back here whenever I had a free weekend in town. As with all things in Brixton, the scope, location and name of the market is open to all manner of debate, argument and conjecture. In this simple fella's mind, and for the purpose of this short review, I'm talking about the indoor market which is also referred to as the Granville Arcade or more recently Brixton Village. Many of the stalls that I used to frequent over 10 years ago, particularly those selling quality meat and fish, are still here and are as busy as ever. Fresh fruit and vegetables from around the world are still stacked high on many a stall at prices which put the likes of Borough Market to shame. Wild looking folk, and other more sad heart rending people, still wander through the many walkways; muttering dark thoughts and strange prophesies  so in many ways it's just like old times and all the better for it. Good food from the yard can still be had from a number of small outlets and my favourite vendor of salt fish patties looks to be doing good business. What has changed in the last couple of years is that a number of new independent ventures have started up. These guys are bringing a more modern; some might say a Shoreditch, artisan vibe to the market. Whatever, I'm loving this attempt to incorporate some new life into this wonderful market and to my old jaded eyes it seems to be bearing fruit. For the urban foodie this is fast becoming the place to go to, with a great selection of small sit down places selling top quality food from around the world. I wandered up the 3 or so miles from Nunhead the other Sunday to catch a movie at the Ritzy to find that not only were a number of stalls on the market open but they were busy, in fact the Federation coffee shop was rammed. To the best of my knowledge the market only ever opened before Monday to Friday and in the day. Sunday opening and in the evening .change soon come? So apart from all the good old school stuff what's new and getting my Brixton Pound: well the amazing Franco Manca pizza joint needs no more publicity, Rosie and her wonderful deli caf\u00e9 is already a local legend, and the Federation coffee shop has already had a four star review from me. If truth be told I would just make a visit and see where your mood and senses lead you; plenty of good places for your lunch or dinner which are still to be splashed across the internet!! My ideal thing is to start with a browse around the collectable stalls, check out the tailoring, upgrade the tuneage, grab a coffee, buy some bread and then agonise over where to have lunch before buying some real meat and veg to see me through the week. By then the sun may be setting and who knows what might happen when you stumble out into Electric Avenue or Coldharbour Lane  Anyway, I generally walk thorough Borough Market on my way to and from work every day and I like it a lot, but it's not the real deal. If you want an evolving, authentic experience of what's happening in London in terms of music, culture and food I would recommend you jump on the Victoria Line and get yourself to Brixton Market. Some might say it's not for the faint hearted but perhaps that's why we love it .. P.S. When I mention stalls I mean small self-contained spaces which are like a baby shop.

I got talking to a man who set up a stall selling organic food and he told me that due to soaring prices, many Black owned businesses that were once there before had been priced out and it's led to a subtle form of gentrification now. Sad really, anyway I bought a bottle of ginger and cucumber juice from him which was amazing.On the way back to the underground station I had two young men calling out to me, but as you brits would say, they were not my cup of tea lol!

The shape, of course, makes it stand out, but there's more to this design than meets the eye: the distinctive diagonal bracing combines wall and roof into one surface, with a series of curving atria between the outer wall and the offices within. This is designed to reduce energy consumption, by allowing air movement within to cool the building in summer and keep is warm in winter. It also provides office space without internal supports.

His palate is pretty limited, but he loves pizza and Italian. I've been to Ramsay's Heddon St restaurant, and when I was looking for great pizza location, Street Pizza popped up....of course I had to check it out as being a huge Gordon Ramsay fan.It's nestled in a very secluded business area, behind St. Paul's Cathedral, on a corner location, I was pleasantly surprised that even though my initial thought it was one level, it was actually two levels and the upstairs was even bigger space.The hostess greeted us right away, and allowed us to sit at a high-top table next to the window. The table was uneven, which the hostess immediately noticed, and fixed it with a napkin. Not knowing the idea of Street pizza, the hostess promptly explained the concept and the days special pizza. She took our drink orders, and came back with some water for both of us. Right away the pizzas were brought around (much like those Brazilian restaurants where different meat cuts are coming around. The waitresses/servers were very friendly and the restaurant very clean. Myself and my friend were a little confused on the days special pizza....which was a sausage pizza. Being Americans, one thinks a sausage pizza with large chunks of sausage, however, this pizza 'looked' like the margherita pizza, (mozzarella, tomato, basil) so a couple of times we passed on it as we thought it was the same thing. When the waitress brought out a fresh sausage pie, she came directly to us and offered us the sausage pizza, and I asked where the sausage was....she informed us it was mixed in the ingredients. Still questioning the sausage, we both waited for the classic margherita to compare them....sure enough, under the basil leaf, was a tiny sausage 'mash'. It wasn't until then, we did notice the difference and was pleasantly surprised. The crust was probably my favorite as it was a thin crust, and just enough flavor to want more. I'm sure between us both, we ended up each having a full pie for relatively decent cost.

As a tourist, it's convenient to have all these restaurants and shopping at your doorstep; the Canary Wharf Underground (Jubilee line) takes you right into Central London within 20-25 minutes (Westminster or Green Park -- and easy to switch to other lines); and the views of the water (Thames and canals) are fabulous.   Great area for walking around or running - it's clean, modern, and safe.  A bonus: The wholesale Billingsgate Fish Market is nearby (although no direct way to walk - it's kind of circuitous to get there by foot, but it can be done), and if you're an early bird (4-8AM) and want to see the freshest fish being hawked, that's a fun place to see!", "rating": "4", "visited": "Jul 20, 2018"}, {"review": "Canary Wharf is a busy, financial area of London, served by a large station with Underground services on the Jubilee line, connecting you into central London or even further east to Stratford, and the DLR. Despite being known for its association with big business and banking, of late it has become rather trendy housing many restaurants from your average chains including Nando's, Five Guys and Wagamama, to coffee shops such as Nero and my favourite Starbucks, and then mini shopping malls such as Jubilee Place and Canada Water. Then there are a few other brands in terms of dining which are a little rarer such as The Ivy, Gaucho and Carluccio's.Canary Wharf is also home to multiple hotels, including two Hilton hotels, including a new hotel in the Curio by Hilton branding, Lincoln Plaza where I had an excellent stay during the night I spent here.There are tonnes of offices and big buildings, which could make navigation around Canary Wharf a little tricky or unorthodox, for example, to get to my hotel from the station, I had to go through 35 Bank Street (cutting through a building) before crossing a bridge, cutting through some construction work and then making a few turnings, to the point it was probably less hassle to pop on the DLR for one stop from Heron Quays.HSBC and JPMorgan Chase are just two of the banks which are based here, the latter is mainly an American bank who I've never seen offer any products in the UK so surely having their European headquarters here is rather weird?Canary Wharf has done so much from making it that treck from central London to a pretty cool place where tourists would actually go to stay, despite having an awkward layout at times such as getting around the area which includes loads of mini shopping areas, which aren't too well linked together it still is a good place to visit in London, and perhaps stay, based on the Lincoln Plaza Hilton I stayed at during my night in London.  the hotels were much cheaper than central locations, while still being a beautiful hotel with larger rooms than you'd get 10-15 minutes down the Jubilee line in Central London.4*", "rating": "4", "visited": "May 25, 2019"}, {"review": "Financial district, modern looking and clean.

Sure, the line cuts across a wide swath of England, not to mention France, Spain, and five African countries. I've driven over it many times in the past 30 years. You'll even walk over the line at least three times on your way up to the observatory, (unmarked of course because they want your money). Any GPS app on a phone will let you observe the location without paying admission.But I believe the admission is worth it, a unique opportunity to stand on a clearly marked Prime Meridian at the very observatory where it was originally established, leading to the precise GPS coordinates we use today. Who doesn't want to straddle 0 degrees longitude and stand simultaneously in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres? It's a bit touristy, hence no 5-star rating from me. But the extensive exhibit is a well-organized tribute to geographic and astronomical breakthroughs of the 18th and 19th centuries.If only they had constructed the tennis courts in the park below about 50 feet farther east, so that opponents could play a tennis match in two different hemispheres. Oh, the missed opportunities. Getting there was easy with very little planning and a quick conversation with an underground employee. We found our way from the Tower Hill metro station (at the Tower of London) to the Tower Gateway above-ground train station. From there, it was easy to take the train to the Greenwich station, with one switch of trains along the way.

When you are in Greenwich, you should visit the Royal Observatory. The reason why I'm not too thrilled about Greenwich and the observatory in particular is that things close down early in Greenwich. The observatory closes at 5:30pm (last entry at 5:00pm). Most shops close before 6:00pm.I'm sure that one thing everyone wants to do in Greenwich is to stand on the Prime Meridian Line. We arrived at the observatory 3 minutes after 5:00pm and could not get in the observatory. We were so disappointed since the meridian line is fenced in! If you're in the same predicament, don't worry. If you go through the gate between the observatory sign and the clock, you can see the meridian line, an extension of the official one (see my photos).

Going downstairs to the venue, we were greeted by more friendly staff. The setup of the venue was different from what I was used to in the US, with small community-style seats instead of chairs and tables. However, the seats were comfortable and the space was not cramped. Initially, I was concerned about what would happen to the cups and glasses after people were done with them, but that turned out to be a non-issue.The seating was first come, first serve, so we made sure to arrive early to snag seats in the front. At first, there were only around 10-15 people there, and I wasn't sure if it would be a good show. However, the venue quickly filled up and became a full house. I made my way to the bar to get drinks since it wasn't table service. Although they didn't have mocktails, I was perfectly fine with a Diet Coke. In fact, I was glad they didn't have mocktails because it made it easier to stay seated and not have to go to the bathroom during the acts.The host of the show was incredibly funny, and I could have listened to him the entire time.

I think I tried to enter rooms out of order on three of the four floors (and only got the fourth floor right because there was only room available).

Dennis Severs was an artist of sorts who basically turned his home into a living diorama that depicted how a fictional family of  weavers (the Jervis family) may have lived back in the 1700s. You pay your \u00a310-\u00a315 (depending on when you go), and then enter into the home. You can't take photos--and anyway, the lighting is pretty low so they'd be terrible if you had. But, imagine starting in the basement. You come upon some kind of dusty storage room with a low and somewhat deteriorating ceiling from which you can hear the creaks and coos of the Jervis family living above you. You peer around at some cob-webbed cups and maybe an old doll or two (unless I fabricated that as part of my memory). Like the other reviews mention (and the pamphlet you'll receive ironically after your tour, though it makes more sense to receive beforehand), the whole point is that you become part of this \"still life drama\" (or, as I said, living diorama). \"You either see it or you don't\" is the motto of the house, which I assume is a weird way of saying you should live in that moment, feel like you're there back in the 1700s with this family, a family you can hear but never quite see. But, you know they're there, as you can see the plate on the table with unfinished food and can smell the candles burning. I does feel like you are in someone's actual home (if you ignore the workers placed on each floor who watch over you to ensure you touch nothing or the signs that remind you you are on CCTV or can use your imagine to pretend the sounds you hear don't sound like they are being played from tape player with a rather poor recording, which many of them most certainly do). The tour continues as you move from room to room and floor to floor, smelling different smells, taking note of a table with a cup of tea, the bedding ruffled as if someone was just there, the book laid open with the page held down by spectacles, the ironic NY Yankees hat on a side table, deteriorating floor boards and ceiling panels in the attic--presumably for a poor tenant renting from the family (I think a plaque somewhere in there said), and the many odds and ends on the shelves and the old portraits on the walls. It is rather interesting to just see what this family owned (or just what Dennis Severs chose to put in his home/museum), even if the items aren't necessarily actually from the 1700s--um, especially the Yankees hat. And, I like that a cat does still live there--perhaps Mr. Severs reincarnated? Bottom line: This place is pretty cool and quirky, but I think that many people will find this a bit less entertaining than the price tag deserves (which could be lowered if they get volunteers to staff the place and open it more often). After all, the light is so low you can't quite see all the objects and going from room to room doesn't take all that much time. And, it's not necessarily authentic to the 1700s--just one man's vision of it. But, if you don't mind spending a few beers' worth of quid on something other than beer, this is an interesting stop. And, you can go have an amazing dinner at nearby Andina afterwards. Or, a nice snack at Beigel Bake.", "rating": "3", "visited": "Sep 8, 2015"}], "reviews_count": "30"}

Some advice: although there aren't really any bad seats, be sure to book your tickets as far out as possible because some areas are cheaper or have more legroom. We were at the front of the second balcony, which was great, but I was a bit cramped (not too bad). Also, be sure to make reservations at a nearby restaurant during the intermission.

It's like having a mini Borough Market inside St Pancras station. Sourced Market is split down the middle as a deli/shop. On one side you can grab some food to go (or stay as there are long tables and stools to sit at) and on the other side you can... shop. For food.Sourced is the name because they only sell produce from independent (and where possible local) food and drink specialists. All variations of food and drink too; oils, cheeses, pasta, baked goods, cold meats, fruit and veg and many others neatly organised around the open fronted store. A special mention needs to go to the beer section. Not only is it extensive and rammed with good quality beers but a majority of them are brewed right here in London. They've been 'sourced' from quite a number of micro breweries and a there's still room for some American craft beers too. Also, if you fancy a Monmouth coffee (as many do) then look no further, Sourced barista's can knock one up for you in no time - unless you enjoy queuing at Monmouth Coffee house in Borough Market for half an hour. I don't. Decision made. Or you can buy a load of it in a bag, take it home and make it yourself.They're seasonal, convenient, local (to me at least) and sell produce that has been made with a bit of love and care.It's open until 9pm on weekdays and 8pm on weekends and, just as a warning, if you do visit Sourced Market you will want to take a a bagful of goodies back with you.

THE BEST EXPERIENCE EVER! EVERYTHING AND MORE! I'm not one to write reviews but I feel like I need to write one about my experience with Secret Cinema- Moulin Rouge. I paid \u00a3130 for my ticket which meant I was an Aristocrat. Before I went to the venue, I was worried that I wasted a lot of money on watching a film and to be seated, I felt like it was a risk I was taking on something I didn't know what I was in for. We were greeted by staff that were dressed up to guide us to the venue. From the beginning of the queue we were made a difference because we were Aristocrats (Didn't need to queue). We had to put our phones into a bag so we ended up losing all sense of time (Fantastic!). When we entered the venue we were taken to the side with all the other Aristocrats and introduced to some wonderful characters which made us feel that extra special. They even knew some of our character profiles (which is sent to us before the event begins).Each person were given little goody bags, who were Aristocrats.Once we had our little experience, we were able to explore the venue. (there's hidden rooms) Without giving anything away, just get involved with everything and the characters around. (Casted so excellently). Even if you're not one to get involved you'll appreciate the effort and hard work that has gone into the venue. Make sure you dress up or at least make some form of effort for the Secret Cinema as everyone that I seen had some form of dress up on. There's only few negatives- Drinks/ food are expensive. The only downside was that we weren't told about the DJ/ After Party that happened after the showing of the film. Normally on a Wednesday we got told that the event finished at 10:30, which we left. Hang around to see whats happening. As Aristocrat I didn't go to my seat straight away, I followed the crowd as the main stage it where it's all happening so go to your seats once the film begins. You have hosts willing to take your order for food and drinks. As a whole experience felt very hypnotic as there were so much happening and I didn't want it to end. It was worth every penny I spent.

We arrived at Leyton tube station at 6pm on Friday 22nd July 2016. Actors/Actresses dressed up in Kelleman's T shirts (the camp where Dirty Dancing the movie was set) guiding us to the destination. The walk was about 40 minutes from the tube station to Waltham Forest. Staff were guiding us to the location. We werent allowed to take food or drink in or cameras, which was a shame. Upon arriving at the forest we were checked in and greeted by actors/actresses saying hello in a American 1960's accent. Food & drink bars around the main field with a large stage and parts of the sets from the movie (the main dance hall & section where Patrick Swayze's character lived) Live music began to start on a glorious sunny day, good atmosphere. The food and drink was very over priced (\u00a37 for a chicken burger, \u00a320 for a plastic bottle of wine) but very tasty and home made on site. The wine was customised to the movie with their own 1960's labels on them. The film started and the actors/actresses acted out the scenes as the movie was playing. We were singing and dancing along.

We arrived at 6.30 pm to find a massive crowd on the outside. We hurried to find our 'operatives' on the outside, and then joined the queue, sealed our phones, and waited for 10 minutes as they were herding us into groups. You're then brought to an entry hall, where they set the scene (despite not us being able to hear anything and a lack of air conditioning).Inside, I must commend the set design and actors, I thought the production value was amazing. I'll keep it to the bare minimum, as I have no wish to spoil the events.The area was massively overcrowded with at least 500+ attendees, all running around. Arriving at 6.30 pm barely allowed us to explore and discover our missions, and we were rushing through it, only to find ourselves too late and that the event had ended. You're then herded into the main room for the finale and the movie to start. Unfortunately, given the massive crowd, you often find yourselves surrounding the actors at groups, all trying to speak with them. You can see they're trying their best to manage, but there's just way too many people. You can't really get into the mood and you don't feel the 'experience', nor the return on investment for paying nearly 90 GBP per person. Not to mention the drinks and food on top of it, with understaffed booths and long queues.Overall, despite the excellent set designs and the best efforts of the actors, the event fails to deliver and ends up being a 'glorified' movie you're a fortune to attend. The return on investment is simply not there.Recommendations:If you intend on doing Secret Cinema, I have two recommendations to get the maximum value for your investment. 1) Arrive as early as possible. Do not attend on weekdays, unless you're able to come as soon as it opens and 2) Do not separate your group with different missions / colours, instead pick one and stick with it.", "rating": "2", "visited": "Aug 6, 2019"}, {"review": "Review for 2016 Feb/March Secret FilmAs I went on the last night of this showing I won't mind putting a few spoilers in so Secret Info ahead! Another outstanding showing. This was my 2nd Secret Cinema following last years Star Wars.

I was lucky enough that a lovely and amazingly generous customer invited me to join her and I'm so so glad she did! The main question with SC is always is it worth the money? The answer is yes. So much. I didn't believe it myself until I went but the team behind it do go all out to throw you into a completely immersive experience which merges film, theatre and interactive dramatics. Compared to the prices people pay on the west end this is far more amazing and about the same price.The film on this occasion was kept a secret (much like their older productions) but as the run is over I'll reveal it was Dr Strangelove. I was lucky enough to go through as a VIP, dressed as a diplomat. The VIP package is a fair bit more expensive but does have some interesting perks. There was a lot of free alcohol! That was pretty great. And they make it a lot easier and more relaxed than it is going through as one of be normal characters, for some this is a pro or others a con. We were brought in through offices where you could see people working behind glass, honestly not knowing if they were actors or punters! As you look out into the communications room it was an excited madness!! We were quite late arrivers so it was packed! Which honestly just added to the crazy atmosphere, hearing the sound of typewriters and the buzz of people. As a VIP we were taken straight to The Love Room, a swinging 60's bar where the presidents birthday was being celebrated. Normal tickets had to do tasks to get a password to enter though as a VIP we were given it straight off! The bar was fab, a massive contrast to the tall ceilings and white lighting of the previous area the love room was cosy with a live band and beautiful singers among the tassle curtains and swanky tables. They gave us drinks tokens and a food token (cocktails were fab! I didn't eat but heard great things from friends). The real perk of VIP was the seating for the final area where the film is shown accompanied by live action on stage. All in all an amazing night as expected.

True, on arrival I was strongly encouraged to buy clothing \"for my protection as I was entering a medical facility\". But \u00a315 for a pair of scrubs I can reuse on another occasion isn't too bad. And there was a \u00a32 alternative.Then some milling around waiting to be processed in a medical area where you could buy supplemental prescriptions (\u00a36 for the pleasant gin based one) before you are finally processed and essentially live through large parts of the film. Lots of running, lots of infected, great sets and attention to detail (though you're running so a blur).Finally you reach \"safety\" at a military base where you can eat and drink and explore more sets. Not as immersive as some events, but still fun. Prices fine for a venue - \u00a34 beers, \u00a37 burgers.Then comes the film. The screening experience is amazing, though acting out zombie chase scenes is odd.

It feels much more personal and involving than the Star Wars event, and we spent a fair amount of time hunting for Communists and passing secret messages along to fellow cinema goers and hired actors. Star Wars I felt like a bystander, but at this production I was much more involved and tasked with actions and missions.  In fact, the film itself was probably the weakest part of the evening, (but still fantastic!). The film choice is great, and had everyone engrossed and loving the setting. The action that takes place alongside it in the actual room was good but wasn't necessaryFood/Drinks: For sale throughout the venue including a cake cart, a coffee cart, a canteen with stroganoff, mac/cheese, hot dogs/burgers etc, and several themed bars with live music and cocktails/bubbly.

Those other 2 restaurants are much more expensive, the Ritz is more than double for the same or similar items.

Our Afternoon Tea was such an amazing experience. You choose from various teas and the tea kettles are brought out. I chose a mint tea and my husband got Earl Grey.The tea kettles are large and hold lots of tea. Once the serving tray is brought out, our server added liquid to the top bowl and it activated the sublimates inside the dry ice, causing a lovely scene.

I enjoyed the scones because they weren't overly sweetened, like in the US.Sweet Blackberry and cherry choux bun, so yummy!! Espresso coffee cream, which is quite a decadent mousse.  Apple, cinnamon and caramel cupcake, very cute and delicious. Perfect amount of cinnamon. Madeleine with chocolate sauce.They also included 2 chocolate gold wrappedmedals, keeping close to the Olympics. We thought this was a perfect touch. It may not seem like a lot of food, but it was.

The only thing that has lasted through the last six centuries is the patch of greenery which Jamie W. and I trodded upon after walking along the Regent's Canal. It was a swelteringly hot day in London except for one slight breeze we felt once we made it to the top of the hill summit. From there, you get quite the unexpected views of central London. A crowd did gather but nothing like the masses that swarm the Sky Garden or the Shard.I suggest offering to take photos of people in front of the view in order for them to reciprocate in kind. Most were very accommodating, and for those few who demur and refused to take your picture, there's a special place in hell for them where they're constantly blinded by flash bulbs. The walk down the hill was also lovely as you see civilized people doing civilized things like having a white tablecloth picnic or creating a landscape painting under a leafy tree suitable for a mid-priced motel.

There is also a barge that houses a puppet theatre.On the other side of the bridge, there is a small turning called Warwick Place, which is the home to the Warwick Castle.

You don't really need to know how to play golf to do well so as long as you've had practice in the past with a baseball bar, cricket bat or are just good at hitting stuff then I'm sure you'll do fine!The best part is they have a fully stocked bar and even offer a range of the usual fast food so the waitress will keep the drinks coming and your biggest problem will become trying to stand up and just hit the ball. As long as you aim for the middle one you'll do fine!", "rating": "5", "visited": "Jun 23, 2014"}], "reviews_count": "25"}

Invited in to have tea with the butchers who wanted to hear \"my story\". ..offered a free piece of candy to brighten up my day by the candy lady.  Really nice down to earth people.  The most memorable vendor, and a fella with great life stories is the man selling London souvenirs and knick knacks at the very end of the market.  Truly touched by his kindness and the most interesting things to share. If you take the moment to listen and experience, this place has much to offer!The market is located conveniently just off the tube station, with of course the same name... And just down the street from a rather large indoor mall.  After a morning of shopping at the outdoor market one can walk up a couple of blocks to the shopping mall for nice air conditioned convenience and more shopping.

Since I don't know what to order, I told the bartender to surprise me with something local. She poured me a Fuller's London Pride Outstanding London Amber Ale. It was perfect because earlier in the day, while heading to Stonehenge, we passed by their brewery. The beer was good and easy to drink. Since I had time to kill, I looked at the food menu and saw that they offered a Haggis Scotch Egg. It's a dish on my list of things to eat in London so I ordered it.

Walking into the club, attendants check for tickets (via phones or physical tickets) to the event; this entryway also serves as a waiting area pre-show, as well as a meet and greet reception spot post show. In the main room, a small bar sits kitty corner on the right as you enter. The stage is set up in the center front of the room, with terraced rows of seats fanning out from center, left and right. The cozy, intimate space and dim lighting evokes an atmosphere of sitting in a fancy home parlour listening to your professional musician friends' jam session. If anything the seating was a bit tight especially given winter coats and such, there is no walking room within each row while everyone is seated, though for those sitting at the ends of the row the aisles were narrow but traversable. The food was delicious, the menu included some vegetarian/vegan options, and although nothing experimental or mind-blowing, the items I tried were well prepared. This included the scallop appetizer, 55 day dry aged steak with chips  (medium rare was perfect) and cauliflower steak w/grilled tofu for the entrees (really tasty job on the tofu, didn't miss the meat and plenty filling), and the chocolate fondant cake with an ooey gooey center. The couple rounds of drinks imbibed for the evening were solid too. The bathrooms are located in the basement down a very narrow stairwell, really only one person can go up or down at one time. I think if any modifications could be made to this it'd be helpful-- since considering a full house the number of people trying to use the restrooms during intermission is challenging. Covid regulations in November 2021 didn't require masks when seated (and eating), and obviously the musicians couldn't perform with masks on. In retrospect given how crowded it was--probably wasn't a good idea to pack the house  (at least given omicron had just started making the rounds), but I can understand how times are tough for live music venues and it's pretty difficult for businesses like this to enforce masks and social distancing given existing limitations.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Jan 15, 2022"}, {"review": "We have been to Ronnies many many times but the last time was pretty poor.

Wanting to have as memorable an experience in London, I did an online search and decided on the venerable Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club (RSJC). I would have to say I wasn't disappointed. Located in the West End, the club was easily accessible from my lodgings in the city. Tickets for the show were bought ahead of time by my daughter, bless her heart. Be that as it may, we arrived a little close to curtain time, and we found that seating is first come, first served. We found seats with tables a bit back from and left of stage, but the sound system is good enough that it doesn't really matter, and the sight lines were only slightly obstructed. We had an excellent server, who was easy to summon for drinks and made sure they came out quickly. We had the \"supper club\" experience on our visit. RSJC doesn't have a huge menu, but what they had was quite good. I started off with pan fried scallops that were nicely seasoned, and surprisingly big. For the main course, I had the Hereford Farm Ribeye, aged 55 days. It came with a plump portabella 'shroom, tomato slice and fries. Priced separately, I also got a side of broccoli. The steak was cooked perfectly to order and was very good. Everything else was \"just\" good. I had a mid price range Merlot by the glass that went well with the meal. I'd of taken pics, but during the music, phones are to be put away and there's no flash photography (as it should be). As for the music, I was very happy with the evening's act, Big Band Metheny. As jazz aficionados know, Pat Metheny is a virtuoso jazz guitarist and composer. At first, I thought it would be difficult to translate his stylings into a big band format, but I would be gleefully wrong. This large ensemble did an awesome job, and there were many fantastic solos during the performance. As I stated, my daughter purchased show tix, so I'm not sure (didn't ask) of the price, but the food bill for 4 was about $487 USD (including service fee and alcohol). So, although not cheap, and a bit crowded with the seating, the total ambiance, location, atmosphere, and quality of entertainment, to me, was well worth the price. I went away feeling that RSJC was just as good as the clubs back in the States that I mention at the top of the review.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Dec 13, 2022"}, {"review": "Really cool jazz club in the super trendy West End neighborhood of London!

After waiting in line outside for about 15 minutes they sat us inside and we chatted amongst ourselves until the show began. Time flies when you're in Ronnie Scott's! After a seemingly short set I looked down at my watch and it was already after midnight! Now that's a good show when hours go by and I don't realize it!The only downside to this space was that the toilets or restrooms were downstairs in the basement down a narrow stair path.

We ended up grabbing drinks at the bar which seemed to piss her off when she eventually came back to see if we needed anything. If you don't want people going to the bar then you need to post that on a sign at the table or tell them when you seat them.

The venue seems to mix the concepts of speakers and supper club in a way that's not harmonious.  But the music is top notch jazz, which makes it worthwhile.I visited Ronnie's Upstairs twice during a weeklong vacation because I'd heard great things about the club's reputation.  My first visit was at 10pm on a Wednesday when admission was \u00a36 and the second was in a Friday at 11pm when the admission was \u00a315.   On the first night the band didn't get underway until 10:30 despite an advertized 9:30 start.  On Friday things were in full swing.  On both occasions I was on my own.  Seating is self-serve with no required minimum.  There was no bar seating; only horseshoe-shaped banquette tables that sat about 8 people and were difficult to maneuver in and out of, unless you were able to sit on the very end.  The tables were not within a direct sight line of the band, which is tucked into an alcove at the front of the room, next to the bar.  If you want to see the band you have to stand up.  On my first visit (a Wednesday)  I stood for a full 90 minutes at the front of the room, with only a small handful of other people, while everyone at the tables carried on loud conversations, made public displays of intimacy and otherwise tuned out the music.  On my second visit (a Friday) the front of the room was crowded with people dancing and the mostly empty tables were littered with personal effects. The Ronnie's menu featured mostly bar food, which included a \u00a316 cheeseburger and an odd steak thrown in for \u00a320.  The drinks ranged from \u00a39 for a glass of wine to \u00a317 for mixed drinks. For a better experience, I'd recommend either improving the food offerings so that the menu is fitting for a supper club (and charging a premium or mandated bottle service for seating), or simplifying the menu and installing pub tables and chairs so that everything is casual.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Jul 5, 2019"}], "reviews_count": "157"}

There are also some other big black hogs, some sheep, a couple of veals, rabbits, and chickens.

For such a small museum, you wouldn't think it would take 45 minutes but it does. The corridors twist and turn with a constant display of packaging and branding through the ages, starting in the Victorian days, passing through the Wars and rationing, ending up in the present.Quite interesting to see the evolving package designs that are based on the tastes of the times as well as world events, with WWII causing packages to reduce tin and move towards more paper packing, plus the recent environmental programs reducing the amount of plastic.A couple of interesting displays caught my eye. It was neat to see that Tony the Tiger (of Frosted Flakes fame) used to have a red collar around his neck and in newer updates has changed to a red kerchief/bandana. The exhibit on intellectual property mentioned that Cadbury's \"purple\" color is actually trademarked.Big display on the humble Bic \"Biro\" pen. For such a simple device, there is a whole lot of engineering that goes into its manufacturing. Looped videos discuss the making of the ball in the ball point and the formulation of the ink and more. It's quite a precision device for something so unpretentious.\u00a36.50 entrance fee seems rather steep considering that the place has quite a bit of corporate sponsorship (Tesco, Cadbury's, Kellog's and Diageo) as well as the location not being exactly a high traffic zone. Pictures of the displays are not permitted, which I found disappointing. I thought I might sneak a couple, but the displays are set up in such a way as to make it difficult - very reflective glass would block a flash and it's quite dark.Note: if you spot a party with lots of kids, you may want to wait for them to pass before entering. The reflective glass bounces the sound around, making it difficult to concentrate on the exhibits.Finding the place is a challenge.

The new site is much larger than the previous home, which was tucked away in the corner of Colville Mews. The museum provides a fascinating insight into how everyday lives have changed over the past 200 years through the evolution of consumer brands. It actually houses 14,000 items of daily life that span the 200 years of British consumer culture.The entrance is a large open space with a really good gift store. The reception staff are very helpful and informed when I was asking questions. To the rear is a great coffee shop, which has a very nice outdoor courtyard garden. I was advised that you can use the cafe and gift shop without paying to actually use the museum. At \u00a37.50 though, this place is well priced.As the museum is much larger, it now has featured areas. The first I tried was the 'Time Tunnel' . It was really good. The content includes so much material. It relates to events such as wars, coronations, exhibitions, and also the 1966 World Cup. There are tons of items covering the evolution of everyday technology, such a the radio, television and computer games. The tunnel itself was quite narrow, and as I visited on a busy Bank Holiday, was difficult to pass larger groups.There is a promotors pitch in 'Channels to the Consumer' with Diageo promoting the Jonnie Walker brand  and an advertising cinema charting 60 years of iconic TV campaigns.There are areas covering 'Brand Origins' and 'Packaging Innovations'. Great to see how the packaging for items have changed. They also lead you through the decades to see how new items were introduced that are now taken for granted as if they have always been there.The museum also houses a venue space that can be hired and a learning space too.

The female bar tender was very good at her job, we only interacted with her, not the male bartender. Good variety of alcohol, but only available snack was cashew nuts (3\u00a3) for a little bowl. Cash only. 4*2. The museum has a lot of weird stuff as you can see from the pictures. Except for Pablo Escobar's gold plates hippopotamus skull, there isn't much of a description on items. It's a tiny winding staircase down one level and 4 tiny rooms. The whole space is cramped. Great if you are only 1 or 2 people down there, not a group of 10 people who have come to listen to the storytelling. There's a lot of sex related stuff on display (books / drawings etc), so this is not a museum for the kids. For its unique character, I'd rate it 3*3. The stories from Irish Fairy tales were interesting, but the story telling itself was not at all impressive. After a couple of sessions listening to story tellers from the Crick Crack Club, this was even more disappointing. 2*If you want to see what it's all about, head here for a drink. The ground floor with the seating for bar customers has a smaller display of items. If they intrigue you, pay up and head down into the basement for the rest of the items on display.

The entrance building is also the gift shop, which you are able to wander around on your way out towards the exit. Nice little bird/duck related products, and it seems almost half the shop is dedicated to children's items!The wetland area itself is magnificent and there are loads of fabulously coloured ducks and geese for everyone to get excited about. The read-beds look beautiful in Autumn and that time of year also rewards you with a wide range of migratory birds to spy on from one of the numerous hides dotted around the site.If you have kids the highlight for them will most likely be the adventure area all the way at the end of the South Route. Be warned though, there is a maze of underground tunnels for little ones to play in and it is one-hell of a pain if they decide they don't want to leave or come out - those with bad backs and find it hard to bend should abstain!All in all a fabulous place that I cannot recommend highly enough, spoiled by one simple, yet vital element that this place HAS to get right - the cafe.

Considered the father of electricity, he had quite a few other strings to his bow - he had a love of science (exploring bifocal glasses and inventing the energy-saving Franklin stove), health (innoculation, cure for the common cold), music (veleoping the glass armonica for which Mozart, Bach and Beethoven composed) as well as being a prolific writer.As a Founding Father of the United States, he is the only statesman to have signed all 4documents that created thew nation - The Declaration of Independence (1776), the Treaty of Alliance with France (1778), the Treaty of Paris establishing peace with Britain (1783) and The Constitution (1787).The museum is explored partly through films in the historic rooms of the house, which has most of the original features and some hands-on exhibitiions of his scientific work. Fortunately, this doesn't include exhibits from the anatomy school, which was run from this building his landlady's son-in-law!The building is also a scholarship centre with a full set of Franklin's published works for study.This is a most fascinating part of London's history", "rating": "4", "visited": "Sep 8, 2011"}, {"review": "We were quite surprised by this historical experience.

Less gimmicky than that sounds, it combines projected images, sound recordings and a costumed character guide to lead you through the story of Franklin's life.

It's a somewhat interesting tour, unique by the fact that there are people who are dressed up in clothing of Ben Franklin's era and they have dialogue that is interactive with a movie projected on the walls of each room. After being in one room for ~10 minutes, there will be a sound in the next room which cues the staff to move on (like a kid crying). I thought this was pretty cool.Is going to this museum worth it? I'd say only if you have a London Pass or if you really love the history and contributions of Benjamin Franklin. It's conveniently near lots of other POI (right next to Trafalgar Square).

All of them were dressed so cute. I loved their dresses and uniforms they wore. We had two people that served us. One was a woman who took our drinks and made sure our drinks were full and stayed full. She was absolutely amazing. Then our waiter who took our food order and took care of us. He was awesome as well. Kept our table clean and made sure we didn't need anything.  The experience was all around amazing!!! The food... I love, loved the stuffed tomato and the rice it came with. If you love tomatoes, like I do, this is the appetizer for you, It's very good! My husband doesn't like tomatoes and he loved the rice with the what it was stuffed with. The onion rings, I didn't care for. It wasn't what I was use to, but I'm American and probably used to all the bad chemicals in our food. So don't take my word for it. My husband liked it, but said it wasn't the best thing in the world, nor the worst. The steak was so good and the potatoes it came with was one of the best I've had. It was juicy and tender and had flavor. The chicken was a little blend, I didn't care too much for the sauce but loved the veggies it came with.  I'm from the south in America and we love our seasoning. So I may have different taste buds. Give it a try still, you may love it. The butter they had with the bread was sooooo good! I wanted to take some butter back home, it's one of the best I've had. Like Germanys butter. The drinks were so good!

And even after constantly reminding them, they still don't bring it out. So was it worth \u00a380? Probably not.Also don't get bamboozled by the \u00a31 at the end, they automatically add it to your bill but you can ask the server to remove it.", "rating": "3", "visited": "May 18, 2024"}], "reviews_count": 1100.0}

This is a must-do when visiting London. It's culturally enriching and sheds so much light on how the UK's government works.This tour was phenomenal- our tour guide, Melissa was so knowledgeable, funny and professional. There are many areas that photos are not permitted, so take it all in while you are there. The backstories of each of the rooms is so interesting and the architecture is stunning. The first chamber where pictures are permitted is nearly 1,000 years old- whereas the rest of the building is a mid-19th century rebuild after a fire wiped out most of the original structure. Definitely purchase your tickets online in advance. They have timed entry tickets and you will need to go through security before entering the building. Houses of Parliament is directly across the street from Westminster Abbey, so making a day of the two is a great way to see two iconic parts of England's glorious history. At the conclusion of the tour, there is a charming gift shop with lots of great souvenirs, and of course, at the end you exit out the cafe where there are some good bites.

Unfortunately they are stingy on photo allowance, but there are many rooms throughout Parliament, all with beautiful d\u00e9cor, statues, furniture, and wood/gold/ceramic details everywhere. When I went, tours were only on multimedia headphones, but they were very informative, clear on directions of where to look and walk, and included different sections if you wanted more information on certain topics. Also, staff around were happy to answer any questions.The House of Lords is more decoratively impressive than the House of Commons, but both have a lot of information and the rotundas and hallways are often just as marvelous. Every room I went into I felt full of wonder. The first entrance you walk in dates back to the oldest time periods a thousand years ago, and seeing the mixes of time periods and ornate details to show power and authority was really unique and enjoyable. At this time, I believe tickets are only available when booked in advance and time slots do sell out.

The Palace of Westminster and Big Ben are structurally stunning, but being able to actually experience how the houses operate from the inside just gave me a whole new appreciation. Not only will you get a glimpse  of the physical chambers, but you'll also get to learn about the Houses work together to make decisions. There's also some great information about the history of the architecture sprinkled in between.Since the Houses are still active, no pictures of the Parliament chambers are allowed. Pictures can only be taken in the Westminster Hall and Steven's Hall. Guided tours are also available (not sure if this is still the case during COVID), but the self guided audio tour is wonderful and allows you to go at your own pace.

Our guide, Freya, was nothing short of a revelation.  Her in-depth knowledge of the venue, the history behind 'Swan Lake' and her obvious love of ballet made the tour one of our most memorable group tours of all time-- made all the more charming by her insistence that as our tour was her 'first turn' at this tour we were somehow getting a 'previews' type experience.  Far from it, the tour was exceptional due to her obvious preparation for the role.  Perfection.The behind-the-scenes peek at ballet build-up was so real we actually had to be told to 'watch out for the real people working' and stay out of their way!  Most fortuitous was the great luck we had by arriving at a moment when we could witness an actual rehearsal from the upper balcony-- truly magical.  Wow.One small note:  the tea experience was average (but did not at all detract from the wonderful experience).  Clotted cream in a single-serve container, very basic tea sandwiches and bagged tea-- and no option for champagne (!) (Full disclosure:  we are so spoiled that we put high tea at fancy hotels on the top of our list whenever visiting London so snob alert!).

This is a cozy (I guess that's par for London places) restaurant/bar intentionally split between two levels: restaurant downstairs and bar upstairs.  The bar is a sit-down bar with plenty of tables and I was able to get in without a reservation n a Tuesday night at about 2000.I ate at the bar, which has a reduced menu, so I cannot speak to the fare available downstairs at the restaurant.  Even so, I had a ribeye steak so I'm not sure what else I would need to go downstairs for.I always want to get a feel for the staff so I sit at the bar.  Apparently this is out of the ordinary because nobody else was at the bar, which seats 6-7, opting instead for one of the plentiful tables upstairs where they can engage in more private banter.  The staff was engaging and lively, with plenty of collegial ribbing and interaction.  I had a variety of cocktails with moderate skill and knowledge required and the bar staff handled the requests for alterations with facility and ease, adding interesting and useful alternatives of their own.I found the staff highly skilled and knowledgeable and the spirits available for a host of quality traditional and new order cocktails more than satisfactory...who has Mellow Corn in London?

I don't know for certain either of those things is possible*, but either way, if you're in the mood for a change of pace and a more chill setting than your average London pub, TBP is a pretty solid call. It's marketed as a speakeasy, and I suppose it normally is, but the day we went they were having a bit of a technical issue (read; inadvertent indoor waterfall). As such the main \"secret\" door was closed, and the more conspicuous side door was how we got in. I knocked a few times like the idiot American I am, only to realize I was not in fact at the \"knocking\" door. When someone came out, we quickly, and in SUCH cool fashion (no chill I tell you), ran right in. We were pleased to find the place realizingly empty, and after confessing to only wanting a few cocktails (apparently you can eat downstairs), we were told to head up to the lounge. It was a cool spot to order a few of their signature cocktails - waterfall and all. I wont ruin the menu for you, but it is full of drinks named after some of your favorite childhood characters. There is one, in particular, that is ice-themed (Tummus's) that you have to try if you're here; it's like drinking a Turkish delight (if you're into that sort of thing).

They also serve dim sum that was generally mediocre and average. The seabass and fennel dumplings however were an exception probably because it is different from the traditional dim sum fare that you can find almost anywhere.

As it gets warmer, there is a larger variety of beautifully raised produce, but I find that some of my of the most enjoyable stands are from the meat, poultry, egg, seafood, potato and dairy vendors.  I generally always pick out some pork shoulder or loin, as well a duck breast or two, which are quickly becoming my favourite protein to prepare.  The fresh eggs are also a must-have for me.  And the hubs always has a half-dozen oysters from Maldon, who will happily bring enough for entertaining purposes, as long as you phone ahead.  The cheese suppliers tend to vary from week-to-week, which is also nice for discovering some of the smaller producers around.  I also buy lovely homemade butter and unpasteurised milk (which seems to be a really big hit with the locals) from the stall next to my pork butcher.  The potato guy brings an array of potatoes in many sizes, shapes, and colours.  And is extremely knowledgeable and what's best for baking, boiling, mash, et. al.

It is also a landmark in architectural history as the first purely classical building in England, and thus the antecedent of two centuries of the classical tradition, in the subsequent Georgian and Regency periods.The house was commissioned by James I for his wife, Anne of Denmark, supposedly as an apology for swearing at her after she accidentally killed a hound during a hunt. The design was entrusted to Inigo Jones, who had just returned from Italy, where he had been inspired by the purity of the classical Palladian architecture there. Work started in 1616, but stopped on Anne's death in 1618. Work recommenced in 1629 for Charles I's wife Henrietta Maria, and it was completed in 1635. The couple did not enjoy it for long, thanks to the advent of the English Civil War. Thereafter, it never regained its prominence as a royal residence. Mary II ensured, however, that the view from house to the Thames was uninterrupted when Wren designed the Royal Naval College.In the 18th and 19th centuries, the building was used as a naval school and hospital and was finally incorporated into the National Maritime Museum. It now houses the Museum's extensive collection of maritime art.Little of the interior decoration has survived, so many of the rooms are quite plain, although the architectural set-pieces, such as the magnificent Cube Room (the main hall) and the beautiful (and photogenic) Tulip Staircase, still impress.The extensive art collection comprises mostly nautical themes, plus portraits of the Royalty associated with Greenwich, and naval commanders. It's a major collection: the artists' works include those by Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Turner, Lowry, with an exquisite Canaletto. A highlight is one of the famous \"Armada Portraits\" of Elizabeth I.The house is free to enter: expect to spend a couple of hours if you choose to browse the art collection.

Four different stories unfold alongside one another, culminating in a huge court scene with the ferocious queen and interspersed with all the well known characters. The Mad Hatter's Tea Party was a personal favourite (and not just for the opportunity to sit down!) - the characters are all very well played, the right balance between scary and comfortingly familiar. Plus the look on people's faces when the scene begins again is something of a picture...worth swotting up if you want to know what's to come!The final bar is where you can revel in the success of escaping this twisting world, with a brilliant little band, bar and hot food available. There's a maze and some flamingo croquet for activities, and plenty of alcohol available. You can re-enter this area throughout its run this summer with your SUIT card, issued earlier in the evening, and worth visiting if you know someone who possess something so powerful.Why four stars?

And after that the fun begins :)Before the show starts you're allowed to purchase an alcoholic drink for the Mad Hatter's tea party, but it's not worth it. The drink itself is quite small and doesn't taste very good for the price. I would skip out on it. I was thoroughly impressed by all of the actors, the decorations and the entire adventure. Oh man those rooms were decorated so amazing - you could tell how much effort was put into it. I was just in awe. However, it was quite difficult for me to follow the dialogue as a tourist. The British accents and the fast pace of their talking made it so hard to understand what was going on :(. Nave = Jack? The things you learn.ENDING: A themed bar that you're allowed to re-enter for the period of time that the show is being put on.

On this wild adventure in the vaults of Waterloo you will firstly be given a choice of to drink me or eat me which the white rabbit will introduce you to.  Then through your journey you will encounter such characters as the Caterpillar, Mad Hatter, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum etc that is all depending on what path you take as there is 4 different ones to choose from.  Near the end of the play you will all go to a court room where you will encounter the big red evil queen.  The d\u00e9cor and the characters and costumes are truly outstanding.

If you love theatre and love to walk through to different rooms and get involved in some way then this is the show to off seen and experience.  The whole performance was a =n amazing take on Alice in Wonderland story. First off you are all put into a room full of books then shown a cinematic short film before you get to meet the white rabbit and I must say his costume was awesome and loved the way his ears moved.  You are given a choice via the rabbit and one of the card people of \"drink me\" or \"eat me\" watch how the rabbit gets smaller and then bigger when he runs to two doors in the  odd shaped room.  Once you have chosen your choice you are then led through your chosen path through the door and you will be taken on a wonderful and unique colourful journey and meet so many characters. DRINK ME (Clubs / Spades - we was Clubs) Each BLACK SUIT gets led through the tunnel to the first scene the Cheshire Cat via the rabbit.    It is set in a black room and you see various puppetry of the Cheshire Cat happen throughout.  At one point you see a massive head of the Cheshire Cat come through the wall with its big bright yellow eyes and massive grin.  The cat was quite scary but what the cat said was very funny.   What you get to see if you were a CLUB:The Caterpillar    Set in a dark room with toadstools around and a very spongy floor felt like we was walking on a bouncy castle but yet spongier.  The Caterpillar was a large size puppet operated by two people.  The caterpillar sat on top of a massive toadstool smoking a Shisa (no smoke came out though).  The caterpillar spoke about many things especially about the queen was quite amusing and his voice was so similar to the voice that you hear in the cartoon. A very spaced out caterpillar.  The Kitchen with The Cook and a Woman with her baby Pig    The cook is making tarts for the Queen of Hearts and he throws pastry at people and the woman with the pig pulls out someone from the audience (my husband got pulled out on our trip) and put in the pot to be cooked.  She then pulls out other people to help season and stir the soup bowl which the chosen person has to stand in.  She also gets someone from the audience to hold her pig (me on my visit) and before you can get to hold the pig she makes it squeal really loudly (she squeals for the pigs voice) and she then quickly pulls the pig back towards her.  It is the most funniest scene as its comically done with the throwing of pastry, the squealing pig etc.  The Tart Maker     Here you get to learn about the queens tarts and get to taste a piece of the queens tarts. EAT ME (Hearts / Diamonds - we was Hearts)Each red suit gets leds via a person dressed as a card through the tunnel and checked in via getting your card via a booth to state which red suit you will be.  All red suits are then led onto a room to see the Frog.  The Frog     The frog is comical and at points shuts certain people from audience that has certain suits behind doors.  The rabbit also makes a appearance through this scene and is trying to get out but the frog does not let him know which door to escape from so the rabbit opens many doors one being a door that opens to another door that is smaller, then another even smaller until he gets to a really small size door.  The rabbit then opens another door and a gusted of cold wind and snow like material comes blowing out etc. Eventually the frog lets the rabbit know which door to get out of.  Near the end of the scene the diamonds are led through a door that leads into a forest and the Hearts (me) are kept behind.  what you get to see if you are a HEART:The Frog extra scene     The frog then teaches us how to do the flamingo salute \"all Hail the Queen, coooo\" that we have to perform for the Queen.     Spying on the Jack of Hearts (the Knave)    We the hearts are led onto spy on the Jack of Hearts and audience talking about painting the roses red.  Whilst we are spying we have the Cheshire Cat (a face of a cat been operated by a person telling us to be quiet whilst spying.  All RED SUITS get to see the amazing Mock Turtle     You get to see a talking moon first of all in the sky and then you see the Mock Turtle wake up that is sitting on a island in a middle of water who then starts to sing a beautiful song and play a guitar amazing singer.All suits BLACK AND RED get to see at some stage Alice in the mirror room, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum (comical acrobatic performance), Mad Hatters Tea Party (unbirrthday song gets sung) and lastly the Court with the Queen of Hearts. All the scenes are comical, the decoration of the rooms outstanding, costumes high end and everything was just so atmospheric, the 90 minutes passed so fast.

The only negative thing is that there are a lot of you when you first go in, but the group splits into four pretty quickly and then it's a lot better.

I ended up getting split up from my friends when were lead through different doors as they were hearts and i was diamonds-i was a bit skeptical about being split up from them and although i would have preferred not to have been, it was still really fun and we were reunited after a while at the mad hatters tea party. The best part for me was the more mellow and beautiful song performed by alexander wolfe, 'the mock turtle'-i think i fell in love! The night was far better than I expected and the aesthetics were more than pleasing, it was magical and so creative. The only reason its missing that 5th star was that it was a bit chaotic! The show started late and there was alot of standing around and queuing before anything started. It was quite annoying you had to leave bags in the cloakroom because they give you little tokens and bits to carry and it means you might not have your money if you want to buy a drink after the show! It was also extremely chaotic when trying to get our items back.

You can see how lavishly and flamboyantly the Tudor family lived. From the kitchen, to the apartments, the paintings and portraits and the stories behind the family are all interesting. Loved talking to the guides there as they gave you more information than the audio tour guide. It's hard to justify how Henry VIII lived: killed some of his wives or just divorced them to get a new wife, his overindulgence on food (5000 calories a day) his cockiness, some would say narcissistic but it depends how you interpret him, self-inflated ego, etc...but according to the guides he was a larger than life figure that everyone in the kingdom loved. He was so liked he didn't even need a cupbearer to taste test his food because he didn't fear poisoning. But the flip side of the coin of having power is the tragedy and heartache that comes with it. There's so much to this tour that I cannot put it all in a Yelp review.

On this trip to London, we visited Hampton Court Palace instead. It was a bit of distance from the city, a long Uber ride, for sure. We had pre-purchased tickets, so it was easy to get in, with no waiting. The palace interior itself was amazing in the aspect that such an elaborate, sprawling palace and surrounding grounds existed for the pleasure of one family. My mind kept considering how many people labored to build it in the early 16th century. During the tour of the interior, I'd recommend the guided audio tour, which was helpful. However, the quality of the device, specifically the jack where the earphones plug in, was atrocious and kept crackling and cutting out. The dining area/cafe was \"meh\". Outside, the grounds are spacious and beautiful. We wanted to take a horse/buggy ride drawn by two handsome Clydesdale horses. It was about 1500 hrs. and the driver rudely told us no more rides, even though we'd just bought (expensive) tickets from another employee. They got into a bit of a nasty row before agreeing to give us a ride, which really didn't go too far into the grounds. Afterwards, the driver rudely told my daughters not to pet the horses as he left in a huff. We ended up admiring the beautiful gardens adjacent to the palace. As someone who gardens a lot at home, these were appreciated. So, as magnificent as HCP is, this visit gets barely 3 stars. Also, please note as we took an Uber to HCP....it was Impossible to hail one for the ride back to the city.

This is a massive building with expansive and gorgeous grounds. I spend a good hour wandering the gardens, and even got lost inside the hedge maze (tip: use the map). They had audio guides available so I was able to immerse myself in the history of King Henry VIII and the drama of the times. Yes, I chose to listen to the dramatized tour versus the scholarly one. I feel that if you have even the slightest appreciation of architecture, gardening, or history, you can spend the entire day at this palace just enjoying the surrounding area.

The holiday special is actually more expensive than the normal afternoon tea which wasn't an option on that day...I definitely wish that they would've notified me of this because I was really looking forward to the traditional afternoon tea pastries. The finger sandwiches were okay. I think I would've enjoyed them more had I been accustomed to eating western delicacies but because they were sandwiches that I would normally never eat, they didn't stimulate my palate. My family pretty much feels the same way...my sister and cousin even opted to order more of the children's fingers sandwiches (you can never go wrong with banana and Nutella sandwiches hahah).The pastries were adorable and some were quite nice but they're not desserts that I would want to have again. They were all on the sweeter side and had very similar textures. I love sponge cakes and wish I could've had more of those instead. The star of the afternoon were the scones! They are so delicious, I could eat them all day, everyday. I was scared that they were going to be similar to American scones, which are generally very dry but these weren't. It was also my first trying clotted cream and now I am obsessed. Despite the disappointing  sandwiches and desserts, would I still come back? Absolutely...just maybe not on a holiday.

After reading all the great reviews of the Rosebery Lounge at the Mandarin Oriental I decided on taking her here. We walked into this 5 star hotel thinking that we were going to be under dressed but we weren't, it was February and snowing in London. The people there were so nice, everyone from the hostess to our waiter. We had  a really nice view of the  street outside, there were only a few people there at the time of our seating and it even more pretty because it started to snow. This was one of the pricier afternoon teas and it costed around $65 to $70 USD per person. They have an extensive selection of teas that you can chose from and you can try as much of the teas as your heart desires. I have to say, we were there for about three hours, they don't kick you out. Although, its not mentioned, you can ask for as much of the tea sandwiches as you can eat. The only tea sandwich that I can remember is the egg and black truffle, it's probably because I love black truffle. The tea sandwiches are round and not your typical triangle or rectangle shape. All the tea sandwiches were delicious and different from the ones that I've tried at other places.  I'm not a scone person as its usually dense and dry on the inside and this was by no means an exception. The scones came out nice and warm, there were plain scones and scones with raisins.They also had clotted cream and lemon curd to go along with the scones which made it more bearable to eat.As for the tea selection, they have an extensive menu that you can chose from. We loved the teas so much that we ended up purchasing some to take home. I bought the rosebud, its actual small rosebuds but it was expensive, I think that they charged by the weight. The pastries were the only thing that we couldn't ask for more of but it was more then enough for my friend and I.

The Duke of York Square Market is defiantly on the posh side with goods being sold from coffee to oysters and everything in between.

My favourite was the West Indian stall which had peas and rice and various meat dishes.  The stall that got most of my business was selling cheese.  I bought a few varieties including my favourite, blue cheese.  The people who owned the stalls were very friendly and you could tell that several shoppers were regulars.

The Rotherhithe peninsula isn't maybe the best known part of the capital, with poor transport links and some deeply unlovely squatting estates, but there's a little gem here if you do make the trek. The farm is quirky loveliness in itself; cows, pigs and goats wander around gently mugging inner city kids and parents for grain before they get turned over by the aggressive and streetwise chickens who really rule the roost. The whole thing is run on a shoestring for the benefit of the local community by a team of volunteers who sell the fresh produce on site to bring in some funds. Piles of eggs from the strutting hens in the yard and depending on the season there's goat, lamb and pork available too. It's a working farm after all and regardless how cute the little porkers are, they taste better than they look.Amounts of this meaty provender end up in the excellent little on site cafe, Frizzante, along with veggies one presumes are also grown here. It's a basic operation with a snug open plan kitchen and mismatching furniture. There's not a huge list on the daily chalk boards, brunches and light lunches mainly, but rewarding enough after a wander round the farm.Breakfasts and brunches looked superb; thick tubes of sausage, golden eggs and suspiciously homemade looking toasts. A jovial notice announces they are now, once more, serving baked beans - a must for any decent fry. Very local eggs are served scrambled with bacon or thick ham slices.Controversially, and correctly as it turned out, I went for a roasted butternut squash quiche. Real men might not eat them, but I know all of the words to Defying Gravity from the musical Wicked so felt adequately qualified. Melting roast veggies in a soft eggy duvet came snuggled into a fresh, thin homemade pastry bed. A thick slice of being tucked in at a country farmhouse B&B.Think twice if you don't like kids.

It has the whole second floor of fast food dining options. You will see different kind of retail stores on its ground floor. Anything that you may need for your travel (out of emergency situation) can be found here. We came in here ( a walk from our hotel)as my sis -in law had rushes due to an allergic reaction and me for a replacement for the lost prescribed eye glasses reasons. We were able to see a pharmacy store that served to both our needs. Like a typical commuter station center, it also offers services  like massage in a chair service, shoe shines service, flowers , etc. Only one thing that turned me off about this place, I did not like that I need to pay a coin to get into their restrooms.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Dec 19, 2017"}, {"review": "We had time to kill and wandered in here from the Victoria station.

The station becomes limited to walking, full of people rushing by you at all directions and it can get messy and dirty. I wouldn't usually advise anyone to come here to eat at the station unless you want to do the fast food feast like we did. Ever find yourself wondering what it would be like to have a place that sells all the fast food dishes, maybe you could grab a KFC drumstick as a starter, Burger King fries and McDonald's burger as a main? Well we found Victoria Place upstairs in the food hall to be one of the perfect places to do it. On weekend evening it's a bit quieter so I recommend you go then rather than a commuters day. Although I suggested upstairs at Victoria Place, sadly Burger King is downstairs so you if you do fancy Burger King as well I would advise getting that first along with other stuff you might like in your feast like Wasabi, Millie Cookies etc.Upstairs there's nearly all the popular fast food chains, Subway, McDonald's and KFC. Plus the biggest bonus is free communal dining in the centre so you can't get in trouble for bringing other restaurant's food into another restaurant.So our feast for two included:Burger King- Texas Crunchy Whooper and chorizo bitesI was always told to never fall for all the fancy burger edition at fast food chains and this experience proves it. The edition of the potato rosti did nothing but add a lot more grease to it. To be honest I think it's this Burger King itself. Everything collapsed on itself, the burger didn't have that usual chargrilled flavour and where were those beautiful crunchy onions and tomatoes?? The Chorizo bites had a weird sweet and sour taste to it and not much of the chorizo itself. The flavour didn't work for me with the mayonnaise and I found the outside batter too thick, although crispy.Subway: Beef and chorizo sub Not impressed with the burger patty which tasted nothing like beef. Probably not the best sub on the menu. But even so, with the chorizo, generous salad topping, mayo and honey mustard sauce I selected, the sub was still very enjoyable being toasted on top. They had ran out of the pork meatballs or I would have chosen that.Mcdonalds: Large Big tasty with bacon meal, 6 chicken nuggets and cheese bites  The Big tasty with bacon resembled much like the whopper I was expecting. It had the lovely fresh lettuce leaves and tomatoes to freshen up the burger. The patty was more meaty although I couldn't really taste the addition of the bacon. Chicken nuggets were still crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside even being left to eat till near last.Cheese bites were disappointing being only given three and had a really hard crunchy batter before getting into the cheese. The uneven texture ruined the whole experience.KFC: Bargain bucketProbably the showstopper of them all. It's a great KFC and yes you can get bad KFCs. Although the queue was much longer than most of the fast food joints service was quick and food came pretty quick. Chicken came piping hot and juicy with a nice mix of breast and red meat. The only thing disappointing were the fries that weren't the lovely crispy ones we were used to. These lacked flavour in comparison to the McDonald's and did not taste like potato. They also definitely need to clean their area as its always atrocious with dirty tables and chicken bone on the floor etc. As the area is pretty big you can almost always find a seat. The crowd varies from loud teenagers to commuters and families but as the space is big the sound drowns out. Although we felt pretty disgusting and gluttonous after eating all that we were pretty proud of ourselves that we finally ticked it off our bucket list. Somehow we still managed to go downstairs after our feast to a different McDonald's and got ourselves a coffee and a berry custard pie and Mcflurry for dessert. Don't ask...

Get down here!It's the pop up that popped up in May, then why and how have I only just visited? I wish I had gone earlier so it couldn't been my summer haunt.This is an elaborate venue. All the fun of the fair with a circus/freakshow feel about it with olde posters donning every wall. Candy floss, sweets. fair ground rides, actual freak show, theatre and lots and lots of bars. There's ample outside and covered seating. Subtly lit in the darkness you could see couples making out in some of the outside booths and friends perching together in stationary bumper cars. The atmosphere was chilled and upbeat. On a date night with the mrs, we booked ourselves in for Fasinating Aida. I would highly recommend you all do the same. Book yourself in for this topical musical comedy and enjoy the quirky atmosphere before it disappears at the end of the month.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Sep 20, 2012"}, {"review": "I've been going to the Wonderground for the past few years now. As a broad rule, you can find the more family-friendly shows in the Udderbelly (the purple upside down cow) and the more risqu\u00e9 stuff in the Spiegeltent (the big circus style tent), but this isn't true all of the time. You don't need a ticket to enter the Wonderground, you can just hang out and have a drink or a bite to eat from one of the food stalls, but it's pretty pricey. I generally go for the shows.Whenever there are bouncers working, they will try to guide you into the entrance to the left of the ticket office, which takes you down into the main cow area. There are very many wooden stairs that way. If you have problems walking, don't take the entrance, instead go further round the left, as this is largely step-free.The bouncers clearly are there for crowd control only and have no idea what's going on with the Wonderground - every year they give me bad advice. Last night they tried to send me to the end of the world's longest queue when I actually had priority tickets. Always seek out an usher if you have any doubts, they know what's going on and will put you right.You can buy two types of tickets for the tent and for the cow - the more expensive tier allows you fast track entry and access to the best seats in the house. Every year I see people in the regular queue getting increasingly irritated because they don't realise that the queue jumpers have paid for the privilege of doing so.If you're taking in a Spiegeltent show, the best seats are the ringside seats (first two rows) and they rapidly increase your odds of audience participation. Something to bear in mind when booking as some people love that and others would rather crawl under a stone! The booths can be fun, but do note that they seat nine people and you will be asked to move up if there are fewer than that number in your party. They don't give the best view, but if you've got the drinks in, it's nice to have a table.All the seats in the Udderbelly have a good view, so the two-tier pricing matters less there. It does tend to get quite nippy inside the cow in poor weather, so make sure you have a decent coat with you if it's a traditional British summer's day.The best show I've seen so far this year is Hotel Black Cat by Black Cat Cabaret - faultless juggling, impressive acrobats and a whole host of other circus acts. If you're wading through the programme, the circus shows are normally good, as are shows involving acapella and/or mouth music. Comedy tends to be more hit and miss, but that's the nature of the genre.You haven't experienced summer until you've been to the Wonderground on the Southbank!", "rating": "3", "visited": "Jun 18, 2016"}, {"review": "I first came here years ago, when I was doing work experience of all things, back when it was a pup, and foolishly thought that this place would be unique and not get too busy, how wrong we were!

There are some absolutely stand out shows here, definitely worth checking out what's on and getting involved, which you most likely will be if you're brave enough to sit it the front row.

The critically-acclaimed variety show has returned to the Southbank for another season of thrills and eccentricity, boasting a solid line-up of cabaret stars, contortionists and acrobatic madcaps. I attended one of the early performances in early November 2015 and, despite seeing the show twice before, I was still brought to shrieks of horror and laughter (often by the same performance!). This time around, the acts include some stalwarts of the cabaret scene, including the impressive display of strength and balance by The English Gents, the dysfunctional display of body manipulation of Captain Frodo and the powerful cabaret stylings of Miss Frisky, all who have previously graced the Spiegeltent. New additions to the La Soir\u00e9e family include Yammel Ridriguez, who performs a devilishly sexy acrobatic act on a single strap, and Melanie Chy, who, after riding into the centre ring on a burly motorcycle, demonstrates incredible hand balancing talents. The established La Soir\u00e9e players keep the show fresh with some new pieces- including one half of the English Gents, Denis Lock, who mesmerised the audience with his astounding bubble art- or by adapting their performance to feed off the enthusiasm of the audience. Even when the inevitable technical hitch of a live performance stalls the show- like the curse of a malfunctioning microphone- the cast barely flinch and recover with ease.The interior of the Spiegeltent has the audience sitting in the round, giving everyone a respectable view of the action, but the ringside seats are worth the investment. As a warning, some volunteers are pulled from the audience at random by the cast- especially those from the ringside section- and you might end up with a performer in your lap. The show runs approximately two hours with an intermission and there are well-stocked bars severing a good selection of beer and cider. Boxes of popcorn are toted by ushers during the break, but there's more substantial food on offer outside of the tent.London is awash with cabaret variety shows, but La Soir\u00e9e has been a consistent audience pleaser since 2009, when it originated as La Clique- it's got a naughty theatrical charm and a grown-up, scandalous character, but it's all very highly entertaining. It's post-watershed, but the most of the debauchery is verbal and tangled in euphemisms.  It's a great night out for a couple- or, if you have something to celebrate- opt for an entire booth and watch the chaos from a safe distance.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Nov 9, 2015"}, {"review": "Well, we booked in to see The Tiger Lilies and we didn't really get it.
