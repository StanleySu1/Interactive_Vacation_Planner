I didn't like is that the Windows were all dirty and fingerprinted and also look like it wasn't clean for a couple days or more made it harder to take pics and record videos. Trick is to dim your camera light and press focus. Thank me later for that. There is a Bar before you go up if you want to purchase a drink as well.

Evening tickets are a little more expensive, but definitely worth it. The cabins are spacious with seats inside and floor to ceiling glass.

It takes 30 minutes to finish.Hours- 12pm-2am Friday-Sunday 12pm-12am  Monday through Thursday Tickets-12 -5pm $29Nights- $39  for adults.

Did you know that this is the highest wheel in the world? Yes, it is 9' higher than the London Eye!My personal experience is varied from the first time riding, and the others, and especially the last time!In my opinion, it is always a good time for riding the High Roller!But, I figured it out when I got on board half an hour before sunrise, then I could see the beautiful view in daylight, and by the time the wheel reached the top, the amazing desert sunset was already there, and the other half going down, the city was already magical from all the neon lights! If you're up to something special, then you can pay for the Happy Half Hour, which includes all you can drink! I personally didn't do that yet but it is on my list!All cubicles are air conditioned, so it is very comfortable in any season.Ticket prices are varies. Beware! My best advice is to check online and buy tickets online! It's much cheaper than buying tickets at the location. Even with a local ID discount, I still paid $88 for 2 (anytime) tickets! Before you go, make sure you don't have anything with you that not allowed! Check the list online! Security is very strict! There are many photo opportunities during the ride.

We went to Topgolf on November 5 between 3 and 5 PM. We brought six golfers and it was to celebrate my son's birthday. The beginning of our experience was amazing. The first server we had and I'm so sorry I don't have his name he was amazing. He was on point. He was attentive. He was calm. We have a little one with sensory issues and he was able to turn down the music in the bay. It was, a wonderful experience in the beginning. The food was good. The service was good. The bay was fun. Everybody was having a great time . Here's where it turned bad . The last quarter of our time there a new server came on . She was young with very short hair and she was not in the mood to be there that night. We had about 19 minutes left in our bay and we had ordered the donut holes to celebrate my son's birthday. We ordered those with the food in the very beginning. It had been more than an hour and a half, and I simply inquired when they would be out With a lot of attitude she informed me that she knew it was in and it would be on the way. I mentioned that we only had about 19 minutes left and I'd like for my son to be able to enjoy his time golfing and his dessert and she said again condescendingly that it would be out in time. I let it roll . The doughnut holes showed up about two minutes before our bay time was over my son wanted to finish hitting his balls and then he sat down so that we can sing and he can enjoy his donut holes .Not five minutes after that did she come back to inform us that we needed to get out of the bay immediately because there was somebody else already coming to it and we can enjoy it in the center area, but we had to move and we were already packing up. I just said could you give us a few minutes? We're trying to wrap up and she said well Your time is up.  remembering that I had said the holes should've come out sooner so that we could've enjoyed it. My husband became quite upset at her condescending tone and her pushing. I'd like to remind everybody this was a Tuesday evening, and the place was literally empty. There were so many bays next to us. It wasn't even funny so coming over and purposefully harassing us to get out of a bay when you were already late, bringing us something we were waiting for is kind of putting a little more salt in the wound. Plus the attitude is really what got to us the condescending I don't wanna be here and I'm angry attitude.We love the service we got before ,we loved the food quality. We loved everything about it. It is my recommendation to Topgolf to not hire or nurture people that will push your business away. Teach your humans that Customer Service is just that Customer Service. She had no right to be as moody as she was, and if she had a bad day before she came to work consider letting her boss know, calling in, or just realizing that Home stays home and works stays work . I am not willing to return to your establishment with my family even after spending near $500. I don't want to be in a situation again where I have somebody being rude unnecessarily. My husband is under a lot of stress we had just worked ourselves to the bone the entire week and we use the energy that we had left to celebrate our son with our family , my husband got upset and he let it be known. It's unfortunate that he got so angry, but he saw the blatant disrespect and it could've been completely avoided. Our economy is not that strong, jobs are not that available, and so when we choose to use what we have in an establishment it's an expectation that we're not gonna get treated like shoe leather. We love tipping and tipping heavily, and  we tipped heavily regardless, and I hope that the young man before her got that tip . The tip for that young lady is. It's not OK to treat customers like that.With that said, I don't think we're gonna be returning anytime soon and if somebody asks for recommendations, I may want to steer them away only because I was there for a fun time not a hard time. I'm sure with time I may want to give it another chance but I'm telling you that all of this could've been avoided if this individual just wasn't rude.", "rating": "3", "visited": "Dec 6, 2024"}, {"review": "You really can't beat the Top Golf weekday morning deal here.

The Haunted Museum is a vibe. I've been watching Ghost Adventures since 2010, so this museum was super enjoyable for me and my group. The dim lighting throughout threw me off. Take note if you are unable to see very well in low lighting. The museum is a thoughtfully designed experience. Your tour guide moves you from room to room. Some exhibits have a video introduction, some do not. We ultimately decided on GA access and I felt like it was worth the money. The full tour took about 2.5 hours or so. They move you through quite fast so you're unable to read all the memorabilia captions and stuff. There are some creepy items throughout. They have a crystal chair at the end of the tour that you can sit in to cleanse you of bad energies or attachments. I will say as much as I enjoyed the museum, I was l a bit disappointed in the quality of items for sale at the gift shop.

My bf and I were back and forth about getting the upgraded RIP pass but figured it was a little too expensive. We wound up being the only people in our group that didn't get it and there are specific rooms/experiences that only the RIP people could do so we did feel a bit left out. The tour was a bit a long, I'm curious if they could do a shortened tour and then the full tour for the RIP group. I felt like while they did highlight on a lot of the artifacts, there were still a ton we were just ushered past. Our tour guide seemed knowledgeable and was nice.

It ended up being one of the longer tours I've ever been on at just over 2 hours. The extended time was likely due to the crowded night from the October rush. We had to wait around in several rooms while the group ahead of us finished. What was great about this place was that it was like stepping into a massive curio cabinet filled with oddities, all of which were gifted, purchased, or collected by Zak. The spooky vibes were definitely on point, with everything from possessions to serial killers covered. And the house? So much larger and more maze-like than its unassuming exterior led me to believe.Now, onto a few things they could improve:* More seating, please! There was only ONE room with chairs at the beginning talking about possessions, but for the rest of the tour, we were standing and walking for over two hours. For anyone in the group with knee or back issues, this was rough and extremely painful.* Get better scent pods! They've got \"signature\" scents for each section of the museum to help enhance the experience, but honestly, the whole place just smelled like a giant funeral home (which I guess works in that sense). Those \"popcorn\" and \"cigar\" scents? Not even close. The scent pods were so strong they stuck in my nose for the rest of the night. My dinner that evening with parsley just smelled like the museum.* Tour guide consistency was lacking. Different guides handled various parts of the tour, which disrupted the flow and made it feel less personable. I'd prefer a more seamless experience with one guide throughout.*\u00a0They offered an \"RIP\" VIP experience, which we didn't opt for, but most of our group did. It wasn't an extended tour, just a few extra rooms to explore while the rest of us peasants stood around the same room waiting for them. It felt like an elitist class separation moment. Why not extend their experience later and keep the rest of us moving? I know I'd be disappointed if I'd paid extra for how they handled that. * Lastly, while there were plenty of oddities, a lot of it felt like random antiques with no real backstory or significance. It would've been nice to have more context instead of just filling corners with \"creepy\" objects.It was an overall fun experience, but the spookiest part of the evening was the back and leg pain I felt leaving the place.

We were pleasantly surprised with how robust and large the various tanks and exhibits were. With that being said, we zipped through the venue in less than 30 minutes - so, do not expect some sort of grand display of exhibits that you would find in the other large aquariums around the nation (think SEA LIFE, but special edition). The ventilation was adequate to mitigate some of the unpleasant odors, while keeping the venue cool for the guests.More importantly, the exhibits were well kept and maintained. In turn, the animals and fish didn't seem miserable in cramped and dirty exhibits. There was a good variety of exhibits, with one hands-on interaction with the rays. Naturally, the shark tanks were the main attractions and stole the show. There was a lot of thought put into the aquarium design and navigation as there was a natural flow to it. The added design involving the inside of a sunken galleon/frigate was incredibly neat. \u00a0Admission pricing is between $30-$50 per person to offer a military discount.

If you don't show up or your late you will be charged $25 so be aware of that. When you arrive, if your early, you will wait inside of The Commonwealth for a host to come get you at the exact time of your reservation , I mean to a Tee.Inside was smaller than I expected.

Some of the important listed rules were as follows:1. No phones out on the tables2. Use an inside voice and \"speak easy\" lol They also emphasized that this isn't a bar so loud conversations or noise wasn't aloud.3. You had to purchase a min of 2 drinks per person4. You had to purchase 1 gourmet popcorn which was $65. You had to be dressed for the occasion (dress code)There were more rules however I feel like these were the more important ones to highlight. The drinks were very creative and averaged about $17-22 in price. Some drinks were listed with ingredients like egg whites, fresh squeezed cucumber juice, maple honey, etc. things you wouldn't even think you can make a cocktail with. There's tons of drinks to try and trust me their stiff!  they also had a faux smell of leather and 1930s cigars for the vibes however you can tell it was fake. it wasn't a steady stream like other speakeasies I've been to.

The Laundry Room, on the other hand, is somewhere you should avoid. Why? Here's my experience so you can judge things for yourself.The Laundry Room is not a laundromat. It's a speakeasy. And one that requires reservations, even on weekdays. When you make a reservation online, you have to agree that you will be charged $25 as a cancellation fee if you're a no-show. Are we starting to see a trend here?I made a reservation for two for a Monday night at 10:15. Once I arrived, the bouncer informed me that my friend could not get in because he was wearing \"athletic shorts.\" He was not in fact wearing athletic shorts. I know what athletic shorts are and they did not fit the bill. And while I hate to do this, it is important information. My friend is African-American.After talking to the bouncer about the situation (he said his name was Darrell though I wouldn't be surprised if he gave me a fake name), I could tell things weren't going anywhere. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that there was no manager present that night. I then asked to speak to whoever was making decisions for the evening and was told that I could text a number instead. I texted the number three times and received no response.Have you ever experienced a bar or restaurant that tells you to text them when you're at the establishment and refuses to speak to you person-to-person. This is also an establishment that doesn't have a phone number you can call. It's email only. Are you seeing a trend here?I then asked if I could go in alone and the bouncer told me that I couldn't because the reservation was for two people and they didn't want to leave an open seat. And that I would be charged the $25 fee even though I didn't cancel. I told the bouncer I would take a picture of him and then he freaked out and went inside. I saw him hiding behind the front door, trying to avoid being caught on camera.Given my experience, it's pretty clear how this business operates. Here's one last piece of information: they require a two-drink minimum per person, they require you to buy their popcorn, and they charge 25% gratuity automatically. Seriously? These are the policies of a speakeasy that treats its customers in a certain way, exploits people to make a buck, and creates fake hype for themselves. I'll do my laundry elsewhere.

The nice thing about this wand, is you can hear it explained toward an  adult perspective, or if you have children with you, you  can also get a perspective, more guided toward children.   I would say that the wand is worth it.   The other two upsells are photo opportunities.  First when you go in, and also halfway through the exhibit at the grand staircase. You are prohibited from taking a photo of the staircase, the only option is paying $20 for a photo of yourself at the staircase.   I'm sorry, I think that one is a bit of a moneygrab.

There are also the claw machine type games up front for those wanting prizes, and couches with TVs to rent console time. Some individual and some group games are scattered around as well!

We did a double showing for about $45/person, so the second show was essentially free. For comparison, one show is $41/person the day of (pretty pricey!).

We have been to the market several times but today was the first time we paid to enter the farm animal section. It was $5 per kid under 12 and $10 for 13 and over. The hay bags were $2. We got one bag of hay, which was enough for my two kids to share. So it cost us about $32 to enter. Make sure you bring cash because there is an extra charge for using your card and you can only do card payments for over $20. They are a small business so cash is easier for them.Anyways, they had all sorts of animals in the back. Cows that were huge! Goats, pigs, turtles, chickens, turkeys, etc.. I thought that I would be upset by how the animals might be keeps because it looks so small or that it would be a bit dirty in the back because animals always come with some sort of mess. But I wasn't! The animals looks cared for and the place was clean. There wasn't tons of poop everywhere or trash. Of course there is poop here and there because some animals roam free and animals have to go bathroom in their spaces. But overall, it wasn't offensively dirty. It was a fun trip! I wish the animals had more space but they seemed content and many are rescued so they would have been put down if the farm didn't take them in. The highlight of the trip for the kids was the rabbit farm where they could pet the bunnies! We went there several times and they bunnies were friendly. We went early, around 9/930 am so it wasn't busy, but when we left around 11 am, the place was getting a bit more crowded. Thus, I recommend going at opening if you want it to be more quiet and to take your time without too many people.Parking is free and ample so no issues finding parking. And in the back area, there are tables and lots of sitting so you can relax there with the kids or family. There is also checkers and a rocking chair for little kids. My two boys loved those and we just hung out there a bit after seeing the animals. They also had a train the kids could play on by sitting on it and horse/pony saddles that they could test for fun to see what riding would be like. And the area was all really clean!!!The one thing we were sad about was not being able to go in the maze. It was closed the day we went, probably because they didn't have enough volunteers. I think this places goes off volunteers. But the rabbit habitat had a volunteer so I'm happy they opened that instead because my kids liked that the most...!!!We also got lucky and saw the peacock open his feathers! He was showing off. You can buy a feather for $1 as a souvenir.If you don't pay money to go into the back, it's free to shop at the market and sit at the picnic tables at the back of the market. There are cats, peacocks, roosters, ducks roaming about that my kids liked to see. That's what we usually did before I finally decided to pay for admission!

The 'ice bar' section is honestly quite small, but still fun and they've got some novelty ice statues including a women's torso that you can drink shots out of. The fact that all the cups are made of ice is also a fun touch. The jackets they provide are decently warm, but the gloves are pretty shoddy. Also, I made the mistake of wearing flip flops in and that will definitely cut your visit short because I couldn't stay any longer than 50 minutes.Atmosphere wise, I went on a Thursday night and it was completely empty, so not exactly bumping. They also do provide the option of buying your tickets ahead of time on their website if you'd like.

Yes, it's expensive.  You pay admission and then of course you need a drink.  We purchased tickets online so it went very quick from when we arrived to the time to get the coats, less than 5 minutes.  They carry sizes small - XX large which is nice and provide gloves.  If you get a cocktail you will definitely need the gloves so you can hold your drink without it slipping since it's served in a bock of ice.  It's around $13 or $14 for a cocktail and $8 for a mocktail or hot cocoa.  The freezer area is definitely cold and was a nice reprieve from Vegas summer.  There are two seating areas, one that's lie a pirate ship and one that is surfer themed.  There are a few other benches and chairs as well.  There was never more than 10 people when we were in there. I think if there was about 20 it would be too congested.   There are a few spots for photos and the staff came in once to take some pictures.  Unfortunately the 3 they took were all in the same spot, so they were all fairly the same.  We hung out for about 30 minutes, which was enough since we wore shorts and flip flops.

The check in was super simple and only took a couple minutes to explain the process and get jackets. I am plus sized and they did have coats that fit which was nice.  We each got a drink inside and while they were kind of expensive, it is Vegas, it is touristy and we were in Mandalay Bay so it was expected.

Now onto the fun stuff... prepare to be bundled up! Before commencing on this icy endeavor, you'll be fitted with a parka and gloves because this place is super cold -5\u00b0C (23\u00b0F). The parka keeps you warm but once you take off a glove to take pictures, it's cooooold. Don't say I didn't warn you. But the cool thing is that there is no time limit. We ended up staying about an hour. I ordered a Truly and one of the cocktails the bartender recommended, \"Arctic Sunset.\" My husband got an old fashioned. My kids got a soda, and my daughter got a water (which was free). The kids liked it, so it was well worth the money. Surprisingly, it wasn't crowded when we came on a Saturday afternoon.

This is something I haven't done before and I wanted to check it off my bucket list.I did a little research on them online and they had an anniversary package available, which was $169 for two people. The package provided 15 minutes of smashing and 30 minutes of axe throwing - 45 minutes of fun. We were required to sign a waiver form online and give out our shoe and shirt sizes prior to participating.We parked near TJ Maxx because it was a very quick walk to and back. I booked our reservation for later in the night due to the excessive heat warning that was issued this week. We arrived 15 minutes early for our 8:00pm reservation, where we were given a safety briefing and a complimentary locker to store our stuff in. After putting on our safety gear, we were guided to a separate private room with a table in the center. On the table was a printer, two computer monitors, multiple plates, a vase, and fake glass flowers. We got to smash these with a crowbar and a baseball bat.When I smashed that printer to pieces, I felt like I was in that scene in the movie Office Space. The soundtrack that we picked, called rage rock, made the entire experience way more eventful. One of the computer monitors was very difficult to break. No matter how hard we smashed it, it just wouldn't break, but eventually it did. After our time was up, we were given a complimentary bottle of water and to rest off for a few minutes. We were sweating like crazy!After our quick break, we moved along to the axe throwing session. Not only we were given an axe to throw, but we were also given a throwing star (aka shuriken). They had a few throwing games to choose from, like Connect Four and Tic Tac Toe. We also chose our custom names - me being \"Axe-ccident\" and my boyfriend being \"Axe-hole\".

A few games you can play without using credits. A lot of the games have no staff members to explain the rules so you have to rely on the tiny screen which isn't detailed.Lots of colors, sounds and it can be overwhelming when you first get to the playground. What game should you try first? I say whatever is available. There are 2 floors. The second floor is quieter but also less games. You can hop on the slide to go back to the first floor...or just use stairs.There's this target game where you have to wear a full body Velcro suit, jump on a trampoline and land on the bullseye. If you're petite, this is your game (I watched heavier people try over and over and they don't stick). Make sure you keep your hair in a bun if you have long hair or your hair will get stuck in the Velcro. They don't disinfect the one suit they have. Gross!They have a giant Operation game, a giant electric shock maze, some word games, memory games, physical games, etc. a mirror room with shiny silver balloons which isn't great/ exciting.There's a bar, a DJ, snacks, candy, and merchandise (hats, beanies, shirts, totes, etc).

Loved the colorful lights room, the beach, the waterfall and of course, we found a seat and stayed awhile in the big final room and watched all the changes.  We spent about an hour and a half.

I loved how they used their spaces. The mirrors elongated and made their rooms a lot larger than they appeared. So I live in LA and they also have a lot of art exhibits to go to. However, most of the time, the exhibits aren't that amazing, but they thrive off of the idea that you can take pictures and that they're interactive. The issue I have is with LA exhibits, they're cheap, dirty, and broken most of the time. They don't have a lot of rules and if they do, they don't have people to enforce them. What made me really enjoy this exhibit was that they had people enforcing rules and I greatly appreciate it, especially since there were a lot of kids. The ones I've been to had kids running around, pulling things, pushing things, stepping on things, which the parents don't care to stop, because their kids are having fun. I'm glad that they have workers who care. Also, the rooms were beautiful. The visuals were stunning and high quality. My all time favorite was definitely the waves room. It felt like you were being immersed into a different world and the only thing between the two of you is that invisible boundary. The noises, the smells, and the visuals were top notch. Absolutely beautiful. My second would have to be the stars room, there was really calming music and the lights would dim along with it. It was a really delicate room as you would have to be careful with where you walked. I was really impressed on the amount of rooms too.The service is alright. I felt like the gift shop workers were a lot kinder than the people working the ticket booths. But like I said, I do like that the workers inside were enforcing rules.

The sketch room allows you to draw/color and bring your creation to life on the screen which is really cool.

They also had a spinning teacup like ride, a giant slide, and one more ride that goes in circles. The lines moved pretty quickly. There was a trail of trees and decorative houses which was cute. Also some local students singing. There was a beer garden in the back for adults only 21+. This was a nice area as it wasn't crowded and had tables and heaters. We tried 2 of the winter cocktails. The ho ho hot chocolate was worth it! Definitely a dessert, came with 2 mini chocolate donuts, a candy cane, half a sugar cookie, whipped cream, and m&ms on top for $14.

There are also a lot of lights for the small kids to enjoy while you cruise the Magical Forest with them. The Magical Forest also has several activities for older people like mini golf, hamster wheel in a pool, and the very famous for all ages: pictures with Santa, (separate cost). The Magical Forest is an event that assists the community while allowing family members, lovers, friends, and everyone and anyone to enjoy company of their loved ones. It is crowded with kids, families, so be patient and watch where you walk!  There are food trucks selling carnival treats/foods, and the gym plays a movie you can relax with your kids with. It's not a bad bag for your buck with the rides and food trucks they have. I think he's definitely worth the price you pay for the ticket! Make sure you bundle up your babies, and yourself if you're cold like I am, and bring your water unless you're prepared to buy some there! The Magical Forest is, (in my personal opinion), more for families with toddlers/tikes because it will look bigger to them and more interesting than what it actually is.

This is to be mindful of turtles crawling under vehicles.  I was also told that the center had new sections added or remodeled, but to me the entire place seemed new.  Very informative, and buy something!  Support the gift shop!  = The Scenic Drive = A one-way road that leads through 13 miles of canyon from stop area to stop area.  And by area to area, I basically mean stopping from one hiking area to another.  Or since the road is paved, and there are no steep inclines/declines you can bike the scenic drive as well.  But I think most enjoy mountain biking happens through the trails instead of the drive.  I'll assume the pavement gets hotter by the minute, and I didn't see any bikers along the drive.  = Hiking Trails = I was amazed hearing there are 26 trails to hike at each stop.  Some being about 8-11 miles, but most between 2-6 miles, and a few under one mile.  Simple, to intermediate, to advanced.  If we had more time we would have definitely hiked a few.

I couldn't stop smiling!!! The staff was really nice and helpful in explaining everything. Granted, I couldn't stand still and was ready to jump the second I reached the top.  They were very good about ensuring you were safe, but you also felt safe.  Each step of the way, they double-checked your harness and ropes, etc.  They signed off on each step, and communication was amazing.  There were a couple of nervous people,reat about answering all of their questions but they were great at making sure everyone was safe and happy.  I ended up paying extra for the GoPro and made sure and did my research on how to get the best quality video.  I asked them for their advice, and they told me to try and keep it upright, and they told me not to look down...but I did anyway and it didn't scare me.  I wanted to turn right back and jump again if I could.  If you are looking for something fun to do in Vegas, you HAVE to try this.  Totally worth every penny.  I would suggest you get the GoPro and make sure you bend your hand so it's facing you. Also, you can move the GoPro outward so you get a video of Vegas, but don't forget to point it towards you so you get your face and reaction.

Sure, it can be rewarding. But I couldn't help but notice a lot of ungrateful attitudes flying around.The jump itself is 1,000 feet up. You fall at approximately 45 mph, you wear a harness that's connected to 3 ropes and they come together like a pyramid and at that point a thick industrial cable is clipped into place.

The cable is very impressive and just looking at it you know it's well maintained and cared for.My sense of time was warped, due to the adrenaline but this is NOT a THRILL SEEKING adventure.

I went on a Friday night, and my family and I enjoyed ourselves. We All Scream has two levels. The first room, upon entry, has a DJ and is enclosed and has a bar and a small seating area. Exiting out of the first room leads to an uncovered main dance floor and a bar situated in the corner. Walking up the stairs will lead to an upper deck with a bar, seating areas along the wall, and a dance floor at the rear of the second floor. In the winter, the setup is perfect for staying cool because the main rooms are outside. However, in Las Vegas, the temperature can easily reach and stay in the nineties and above, even at midnight and beyond, so it can remain hot. The nightclub does serve Ice Cream, which can be a godsend in the summer months to cool down! The main dance floor stayed packed once they opened the dancefloor up for patrons at midnight, and the DJ kept the party going, playing Hip-Hop throughout the night. Downtown Las Vegas has a different feel than the strip, so I wanted to take my family to We All Scream to experience a side of Las Vegas that drastically differs from the glitz and glam of the Las Vegas nightclubs. We All Scream is also an excellent place to meet locals because Las Vegas residents are likelier to go to the Freemont district, while the strip will have a vast tourist presence.

Winding into the canyon you'll go past Nelson, and then spy the old mining town.  Lots of knick-knacks, old cars, western stuff and of course, mining tools scattered around the properties.  Park, go in and pay the $15.  There were 6 of us in our tour group.  Bruce comes out and amiably asks where everyone's from, and thats where he might assign you a nickname if he likes you.  lol.  Anyway, Bruce was a great story teller, and gave us the lowdown on how gold was mined, the tools they used, what life was like back then.  They have lots of old photos and even a mine drawing.Finally, he led us down the rocky trail, past interesting displays, like the old jail cell, which he locked me in, and tools.  Then he led us into the mineshaft.  This was AMAZING.  They've done a great job, wiring the shaft with old-style lanterns lighting the way.  Its a few degrees cooler in here, with a breeze blowing in from some unseen sky-hole.  Bruce showed us how they followed quartz veins, and gave showed us how they used the manual tools to hammer out the material.  Omigod times were hard back then!After we exited, Bruce volunteered to take pics of anyone in front of the mine entrance using our phones (which everyone accepted).  And thats it.  Bruce walked off and let us explore the grounds on our own; I wouldve offered a tip but apparently thats not 'the way of it' here.EASILY the best outing of our most recent Vegas trip, highly recommend.  Bonus - explore the rest of El Dorado canyon on your own, beautiful views of the river here.  And the amazing solar panel arrays in the valley will blow your mind as you head back.ps, I really appreciated the low-cost t-shirts which they offered in the 'XLT' (tall) size.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Oct 6, 2024"}, {"review": "El Dorado Ghost town.

The employee was pushy to get our time started and I said I didn't want to start until I had clubs ready to play. She seemed to understand and said she would go get those.

The calamari was lightly fried and didn't have a lot of batter which is perfect. The calamari doesn't have a lot of seasoning but there is a tasty sweet chili sauce included on the side. The fries were fresh and seasoned. Our least favorite item was the Garden Flatbread because the dough was too thick and the toppings were not fresh. Golf: The Atomic Golf experience is really fun. There are multiple types of games to choose from. We enjoyed 21 and Distance. The only suggestion I have is to ask for a set of left-handed clubs ahead of time, if needed. I am left-handed and it took a while (almost 45 minutes) for the lefty clubs to arrive to our bay. Extra: We didn't know about the residency Drone Light Show until we got there but it was cool to see.

If you continue down there's another pool with a little bath. The warm waterfalls are great. Also go down to the river. On the left there's a really hot waterfall. River water is cold. Little hike through the water will get you to a hole in the wall in your left which you can easily go up and you will find a gem: dark tunnel with knee deep water. We called it the sauna tunnel. We walked to the end with a flash light in our phones and back.Two of our group came later and missed the hole, not sure how that was even possible it's obvious. Back up it took is hours solely because one of the group was just point blank a pain in the ass: only talk and laugh and complain and acting like she was gonna die climbing back up. If you haven't hiked in decades then don't burden others and don't come on this hike. We also saw a family with 2 toddlers and a new born on flip flops, this is so irresponsible especially none were wearing helmets. Water shoes are recommended. I walked in my sneakers. But for getting to the pools I recommend shoes with grip as it's often slippery and my sneakers didn't do well with that. Also don't bring your dog if you can't carry him on your back or handle the narrow rappelling, we also had to help idiots of that kind. Bring enough water and snack. Lovely way to spend the day especially fall when there's excellent weather and you can enjoy hot pools.

Hot springs water run down the trail so need to jump or walk throw the warm water. The bouldering was super fun and thank goodness some professionals installed the knots and ropes are very difficult sections, peaceful on non busy weekends. Cons: young punks bringing their portable speakers and thumping their music at the hot pools, worried about seeing some people not prepared for the challenges of the full hike (saw some people entering the trail at 3pm, no backpack of food or water but just a camera bag, bringing dogs)Visited in the fall and the pools are natural and the earlier pools are the hottest and the longest one at the very end isn't too hot , just like warm. If you're thinking of soaking tired feet , it's better to do it at one of the earlier pools like 3rd or 4th.  You won't be able to submerge past your hips in the earlier pools but the final one is usually more crowded AND it maybe just warm temp.Without bringing gloves, it would be 40% harder to scale the ledges and control the rope climbs. The best hike I've been on in the Vegas Nevada area. 6 & 7 year old girls were there, they been there before with their very experienced parents (locals) and had good shoes. If you have the will , skill, strength and endurance to return, you'll be fine. Many women had issues and delays on the rocks and rope climbs due to lack of arm, shoulder, and muscle strength.  Lots of gym ladies in their yoga pants were extra slow because lack of coordination with hands and grappling experience.  Kids and teens should do fine as long as they are positive and done hikes before.

The difficult parts are those obstacles along the hike which if you can't complete you'll never get to the hot springs or even the Colorado River.

I would use a light jacket at least until there's Sun or you warm up. You'll pass under a bridge which gets a little loud as cars pass. You'll see various things like steel cables, abandon cars, caves, maybe some wild animals, and of course the water.Bring a towel, extra clothes and footwear so you can relax and take a dip in the water or just dry off before you head back. Slippery footing makes it just a little more difficult than it should. Bring some food and drinks since it's not a short hike. Enjoy it and have fun.

You will need snow shoes, proper clothing etc. One of my reasons for wanting to go up the trailhead in the winter is because my friend told me the waterfall is actually frozen over and it's an amazing sight to see! ***SUMMER***If you come here during the summer it is an amazing easy hike. The only part that gets difficult is when you start to do the stairway towards the last three quarters of a mile.  The parking lot is open during the summer and it's easy to find parking there is plenty of spaces.  There is a Metro Police station about 3/4 of the way once you make that turn to get to Mount Charleston that's pretty much a straight away so I wouldn't go over 65 mph and actually pay attention because they are out there.

Traditionally, these falls are generally pretty lifeless due to lack of winter snowfall, but since we had such a wet and snowy winter I knew they were going to be amazing!Always best to go in the early morning if possible to avoid the crowds and obtain a parking spot near the trailhead. I went up on a Tuesday morning and was greeted by a beautiful deer as I entered the parking lot. When I arrived there was plenty of parking but by the time I left, it was filled and overflowing along the side of the road. Per the AllTrails app, it states the hike is 3.1 miles round trip. My watch logged additional distance. As you ascend the mountain, you begin a slow up hill climb nothing too difficult. Lots of gravel to maneuver through and then eventually the path becomes a single track and all dirt, rocks and tree roots to walk over. Once you hit the switchbacks, this hike hits a whole new level. I wouldn't categorize it as difficult, but you will get winded as you climb. Lots of steps to climb on the switchbacks and it can get tricky towards the top, so be sure to watch your footing. I would definitely recommend wearing hiking boots or trail shoes with a grip. It is recommended to be in decent physical shape for this trail as I saw many people struggling to breathe and looking peaked as they made their way up. Take this trail at your own pace and take frequent breaks if you need to.Once I arrived at the falls, there were three falls flowing big time! It was so breathtaking and the mist from the falls was refreshing to feel. I was able to grab some great pics and video. I sat up there for a good hour or two. I sat down and just took in all that nature had to offer and it was a perfect way to spend my morning. As I looked towards the Charleston Peak, the last remaining snow is trying to hang on but very little left. We had one heck of a year and to see snow this late in the season is pretty unusual.  The only negative about this hike or any other hike I have done lately is some people feel they have to bring music and blast it while they are hiking. WHY??? This is so irritating!!

Unfortunately I knocked the stars down because the photographer was not very skilled... My husband uses a nice camera every once and a while and learned how to do it really well on YouTube. The photographer here did a less than stellar job if I'm honest. Genuinely, the photographer kind of just picks up a camera and clicks a button. They aren't very knowledgeable about how to take photos with lighting in mind, frame, scale, or even the position they should be in to just take the photo in the way it's meant to be posed at the museum. Aside from that, I also would have loved some direction but it was a fairly quiet experience.Come for a new experience but don't expect the VIP experience to be anything better than your friends taking a pic of you or taking a selfie.

I would say this trial is definitely for the adventurous. As a first timer, I ended up giving my ATV to my husband as his experienced issues and ended up riding in the buggy with Horatio.

We booked your Family Fun Romp on 10/21 along with our friends. There were 7 of us total. The shuttle driver was amazing and so was our tour guide but we experienced some setbacks that made the experience not as enjoyable. About 5-10 minutes into our tour our friends buggie didnt have enough power to get up the first hill and they were in front of us so we had to reverse our buggie down the hill so they could get down. When we did that our buggie died out and could not restart. Our tour guide had to get another buggie for us so we waited for about 15 minutes until he got back with a new buggie for us. He also grabbed another buggie for our friend that was supposed to have more power. We continued on our tour but noticed our friend with the new buggie who was last in line was lagging far behind. When we eventually stopped he said his buggie does not have enough power so it was going slower than the rest even at full throttle. He had to just keep driving that buggie because there was no more extra buggies. So he didnt get the full experience he was expecting. after about 30 minutes into our tour our 4 seat buggie tire axel broke almost completely off. We did not feel safe continuing with the tour driving that buggie. Our tour guide was so nice and he switched buggies with us so my husband went into the 2 seater buggie the tour guide was driving and i stayed in the four seater with the instructor driving it back in. Our experience wasnt that great with all the set backs. We didnt get the full 1 hour experience of actual driving and riding due to all the stops due to the issues. We explained the situation when we got back to the ladies at the counter and asked to speak to a manager but was told to write an email instead to quality control and that they would get back to us within 48 hours. We asked for a manager/owner and was told there was none there at that moment but found out the owner was indeed there and came out to where we was talking to the front desk lady about our experience but we didnt know that was the owner until later because he did not say anything to us he just eaves dropped on what we were talking about to the front desk lady.overall we tried to make the best of it and got some great pictures but the actual driving experience was not that good and was cut short. I think its time they upgrade their buggies if they want people to have the full experience that they promise.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Jun 17, 2023"}], "reviews_count": "803"}

My group of friends and our families did a big trip to Las Vegas during December. My best friend really wanted to be bougie and get a luxury spa set at one of the The Strip hotels. Me being a yelper, I wanted to get the best experience possible and I found this oasis! We had a group of 4 who wanted both massages and facials. The staff was able to accommodate us as best as they could due to the size and spa packages we were requesting. One friend wasn't able to book a facial, but the day of they squeezed her in! I had the Tranquility spa package - Full Body Massage, the Classic European Spa Facial and Raja Retreat treatment. My package started with the facial. The staff member was super friendly and nice. She brought me a nice plush robe to change into and I felt so cozy. She asked me some questions about my skin concerns and if I had any allergies, and then went to work. The steamer was amazing, I felt like I could breathe so much better. The products she used stung for a little bit (another friend expressed this too), not sure if it's because I have sensitive skin. However, I felt so refreshed and smooth. She did recommend an additional treatment but it was my very first facial and I wanted to just enjoy it as is. When the facial was over she took me to the patio to relax and wait for the Raja Retreat. I believe I had Amy for my Raja and I want to say THANK YOU! You were amazing!!! You made me feel so relaxed, as a new mom it was so nice to mom chat about our children. Legit you made my whole day! My whole group of friends loved how caring you were , and all the recommendations you gave for us to explore. My swollen sore feet were revived, and the head massage was just heaven. Hands down that Raja Retreat out on the patio with tea, honey and a cookie, chilling spilling tea (LOL) was the highlight of my whole vacation. The last part of my package was the massage. So this was my second massage, my first was a prenatal back at home, and well it was okay. So my masseuse wore a mask, and I totally respect that (I wear masks everywhere due to my baby). The problem though was she was coughing. She had warned me she gets coughs this season especially, and I was fine until later in the massage. It went from one cough to a hacking cough, and that's not relaxing. Before the massage started she asked me about my problem areas, I expressed that I have an infant and a desk job so my shoulders are constantly hurting. She did work on them but it wasn't nearly as much as I was hoping for. I know I could have asked for more attention and pressure, but with her coughing continuously I don't know if she could have and I felt just uncomfortable.  My prenatal massage back at home was more intense how I prefer it. The staff let us relax on the patio as long as we liked to wait for our friend who did the Ultimate Spa Rejuvenation. It was so peaceful and relaxing.Overall, our group was so happy with the experience. We'd love to come back for our next Vegas trip. I think next time I would ask if the order could be rearranged a bit, because the facial was so refreshing and the massage face down made it feel like the experience was wasted a bit.

The arcade is small and becomes cramped very quickly if more than one party is present.

This is probably better geared towards small children looking for Nintendo plushies than any Japanese Game Center aficionado. The selection of items in the claw machines is quite small. The trade-in system is useful if you're looking for something huge to gift someone. You could also just buy a clean plushie from Tokyo Discount. The smaller machines are programmed to play Girls Generation's \"Gee\" on repeat; if you're like me and consider this a form of torture, avoid those machines.", "rating": "2", "visited": "Jul 31, 2024"}, {"review": "My daughter and I decided to try out PICK ME Claw Arcade, which is located off of the 95N/Lake Mead exit. It's right next to Panera Bread and Taj Palace. There are plenty of parking spots available too!We stopped in around 3:00 P.M. on a Monday afternoon. There was no one inside PICK ME Claw Arcade except us! Unfortunately, the AC wasn't working, and it was 115 degrees outside! It was pretty warm inside PICK ME Claw Arcade. The team member at the front had stated that the AC technician was supposed to arrive earlier in the day but never did. It was rescheduled for 4:00 P.M. the same day.There are a lot of claw arcade machines available inside PICK ME Claw Arcade. There are some standard plush machines and some miniature ones that have key chains or mini purses! 1 Token Per Game play$5   5 Tokens$10 11 Tokens$20 24 Tokens$50 65 Tokens$100 135 Tokens1 Trade in (same Day redemption)1 Prize Wheel Spin on Every $40.00Guaranteed Win - 12 Tokens.We also got 2 tickets for the monthly raffle. It was for a large Large Cinnamoroll Bunny!We ended up getting 3 extra tokens for the prize wheel spin since we purchased the $50 for 65 tokens!The games were interesting. Unlike a lot of other claw arcade places in the valley, the machines are set up differently. The mechanic is that it will pick it up and immediately drop the prize until it's programmed to win. It would continuously drop the prize from the claw. It was difficult for me, but my daughter didn't mind it too much!Some of the plush included Mario Themed, Kirby, Capybaras, Sanrio products, and much more! I was hoping to get the Piccolo Key Chain from Dragon Ball Z. We spent about 10 tokens, with no luck getting it, unfortunately! The customer service was absolutely phenomenal at PICK ME Claw Arcade. The team member who helped us out was great! I'm glad we had a chance to stop by this claw arcade and try it out! They're opening a new location at Craig/Ann as well in the upcoming months!", "rating": "4", "visited": "Jul 8, 2024"}, {"review": "We highly recommend this location! We went to one other claw place and the service at Pick Me Claw Arcade was waaay better. I asked the lady behind the prize desk if she had any tips and she gave me a hint, which is more then other places have done. She said to try and get the plushies closer to the square hole because those give us a better chance of winning.At the end of the day, the machines are still randomized--sometimes you win and sometimes you don't. It is like gambling for kids! But I like this location because they help make it a little easier for kids who are playing. I have a 5 year old and 2 year old and they made sure that my kids didn't go home empty handed. And they did it with a smile. That was what made things comfortable and less stressful for me. If we left with nothing, I would have some seriously sad kids! And at the last claw place, I only won one toy so that left one kid happy and one kid upset.As for the quality of the plushies, they are good! I don't think they felt or looked cheap at all. I thought they were soft and didn't feel like those cheap carnival prizes you get at circus circus. My kids were plenty happy with them. No complaints.It is also very clean and set up where you have plenty of space to play without being bothered by other guests. Though, we went when no one was there so we had the place to ourselves. We didn't have to rush or compete for machines. I can see the place getting busy on the weekend because the space is a little small for many people. But still was a super cute shop.The claws themselves usually always pick up the toy. The lady told me that the machines are programmed to always pick up the toy if you place it properly in the center, but whether it'll hold on to it all the way to the exit depends on your luck. I always thought that claw machines were based on skill, but after going to a couple of these places now--I fully believe and understand that it is mostly luck! Though, you must have the skill to place the claw correctly and also do it within the time limit and find the plushies that can be picked up and aren't stuck in the machine. Finally, pricing. It was $10 for 11 tokens and $20 for 24 tokens. And each machine cost one token, so $1. If you buy over 40 dollars, you get to spin the wheel, which can win you some bonus tokens. We did the $20 deal because it was our first time here and we wanted to just test things out. But I would come back and possibly spend a bit more to spin the wheel and get more plushies. The kids can trade the plushies up for bigger prizes. I think you would need at least 6 to start getting the trade-ins behind the desk, but that seems fair. Some of the really big ones require a trade in of 18-24 plushies...so you'd have to get really lucky for those.Overall, this was a fun little stop for us. My kids do everything really fast so it occupied them for about half an hour, but we got plushies out of it and they left with big smiles and wanting to come back. Oh yeah! And they have a stool for little kids to stand on so they can press the button and move the controller. This was awesome because I didn't have to worry about carrying my kid to see the machine plus holding my stuff and also holding the coins and prizes.

Depending on the time of year, the weather can be very hot or just perfect. On this trip we had an 83 degree day and light wind.Willow Beach Harbor (should be marina not harbor)  is located just across Hoover Dam in the state of Arizona. It is within the Black Canyon region and has over 235 miles of shoreline to explore. Lots of parking, a convenience store, picnic areas, boat launch area and a campground.I have kayaked here twice now. The first time, my friend and I rented a double kayak from the marina. I believe we paid $130 for the day. They also have single kayaks, canoes, paddle boards, and small boats to rent. This time I went with my bestie who owns two single kayaks. The key is to arrive early morning. The reason is unfortunately, there are way too many tour groups accessing the water now and it can become crowded which stinks if you are seeking some serenity on the river. The first time I went there was not a lot of people but this last time it was a bit extreme. Lots to see once you are out on the water like old equipment from mining days, wildlife such as bighorn sheep and the beautiful Emerald Cove. We were lucky enough to see an incredible bald eagle which is rare.You can kayak all the way up to Hoover Dam but it is 12 miles so get ready to work. You can also kayak  to the Arizona Hot Springs Beach which is a little over six miles up river. You will find many beaches along the way where you can pull in, have lunch and take in all the epic views. It's very peaceful out there and the water is pristine. So clear but definitely cold. Near the shore the water is warmer but the deeper you go it will wake you up quickly. Be sure to wear water shoes, bring sunscreen, quick dry shorts, a long sleeve rash guard, bathing suit, and a big hat. Plenty of water is a must plus food.

I'm not sure what the fee is off the top of my head since I have a pass. Bring sunscreen--I regularly wear tanning oil and still come out with lobster legs.

Just opened the Monday after Vegas Super Bowl. Celebrated \"Galentine's\" here & by Galentine's I really mean, I was \"3rd wheeling\" my cousins' date with her husband. Immediately, I looked to see if there was food being served here -- looked like \"no\" so, I made sure to eat beforehand cuz ya girl woulda been Hangry. Immediately noticed the large signs that said, \" NO PHONES ALLOWED!\" I'm thinking \"EEK!\" But the bouncer said \"we allow phones - but, NO PHOTOS.\" Ok, that's fair. I know Bruno's residency shows are \"no phones allowed\" so, I thought they were gonna make us put our phones in a bag or something. It was actually quite funny to watch security run up on people when they started filming or taking photos lmfaoAnyways, as we were walked to our table, I noticed Bruno Mars HIMSELF. White ball cap; walking to his table as we were going to ours. He looked me in the eye and smiled, I'm thinking \"whoa, Bruno is here!\" =)And he stayed for the 2+ hours we were there; maybe business meeting; surely supporting his bar, his rum (which is served here) and of course, supporting The Hooligans. Which are his band mates, who are the performers here for the first 2 weeks here.Small venue aka \"intimate.\" Cute vibe. Typical speakeasy situation with dim lights and rotating chairs, cushy couches. Bruno's numerous Grammy awards lined the walls in the entrance, which was a cool aesthetic. I know I've never seen a Grammy in real life! Drinks typically started at $20. Hashtag Vegas, right. My cousin ordered their \"specialty espresso martini;\" I got their specialty rum drink; and her husband got \"the Hooligan\" drink. All were basic drinks/nothing special, except that espresso martini drink they make --- it was whatever but, took too long (maybe 20 mins) to make. And I'm not exaggerating when I say that cuz even the waitress came over to say 'sorry for the wait' as \"they make the caramel foam and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e banana in house\" -- blah blah. We joked that they were growing the bananas. It was annoying! Wish we were told that it was gonna be that long or else we wouldn't have ordered it. Plus, there's a 2 hour limit to the table so, we wasted time waiting!!!!!!!!This is surely a sign that \"it's a new venue\" --- (basic) DRINKS TOOK FOREVER. AND SERVERS/STAFF TRYNA FIGURE THINGS OUT.My saving grace for the night were The Hooligans cuz they killed it. Their musicality is always top notch. Playing jazz sets but, also making us dance with hits from Biggie and Mase. Forgot to mention, there's a dance floor! Just a note; if you get a table on the dance floor, be prepped to be eye level to ppl dancing their ass off; no ropes, so no personal space =(I would def come back again just for the live music, which is few and far between in Vegas. And I'm not talkin' expensive concerts/residencies.

We visited four restaurants and sampled their specialties, both food and drinks. It was definitely an eye-opener to places we would never think of trying for a meal on our own.

I was greeted by a lovely young lady who actually teaches the pottery classes. She explained how the process goes and gave me a pallet to put my paint on. So how it works is, you pick a ceramic that you would like to paint. Ranging between $10-$60 bucks. I picked the elephant piggy bank that was $52 bucks. They also charge a shop fee of $9 per person for the paint materials & to melt the ceramic when it's done. You also don't pay until you're done with your art as well. They keep the ceramic for 14 days and will text you when it's ready for pick up. They have aprons so the paint doesn't get on your clothes but keep in mind it is all washable paint. They have nice music playing in the background while you paint & they also have snacks for purchase. Really amazing time. Keep in mind they do close at 9. So I came in at about 7:30 & felt kind of rushed to leave at about 8:40. A young lady with red hair that I hadn't saw all evening came out & just started grabbing paint off my table at 8:55 & asking if she could take the bowls & brushes & that I needed to head to the counter to checkout. So she was pretty rude & snappy but other than that little hiccup it was a wonderful experience. I came back on the next day to finish & it was wonderful.

We were hiking from about 12:50pm-4:20pm.TOTAL MILEAGE: 7.9 miles according to my Strava (it tends to estimate high), 1210ft elevation gain, going counterclockwise (we did this so we would climb the ladder, vs going down the ladder).PARKING: Plenty at 12:30pm MT on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. The lot was maybe 1/4 to 1/3 full.AMENITIES: None at trailhead. No water, no restrooms.CELL SERVICE: None for most of the hike (T-Mobile).SHADE: Plenty, as most of the hike was in slot canyons! If the sun was directly overhead, there would be a lot more exposure. A few parts were very exposed: the middle section parallel to the Colorado River, the first and last half mile or so. VIEWS: Interesting rock shapes. The slot canyon was nice but also a little typical if you've done this type of hike, and this one wasn't very spectacular in terms of color. The first thing that wowed me was the Colorado River, which was a gorgeous teal blue and crystal clear. The hot springs were not so sparkly clean probably due to all the traffic, slightly cloudy but not dirty/muddy by any means. Still, it was relaxing to sit in them, and everyone there was friendly! There seemed to be a lot of regulars who knew each other. And yes, a lot of nudity, but it didn't feel like a big deal at all.DIFFICULTY: Mild to moderate, for an avid hiker. Keep in mind that after sitting in the hot springs, your legs will feel like jelly. Humans were not meant to go on even moderate hikes after soaking in hot water! I had a lot of difficulty with the last mile or so going counterclockwise, as this section had the most sudden elevation gain. Would not have been a big deal at all normally, but my muscles were just so weak after the soak!Note - the trail is very difficult to follow going along the Colorado River. There are some spray painted arrows but even following those, we think we ended up \"off-trail\" and had to slide down a very steep section to get back on the main route to find the ladder & hot springs.CROWDEDNESS: On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, mostly empty. We encountered a couple groups during the first half. A few more along the Colorado River (one was cliff jumping into the river!). Then we got to the hot springs and there were probably 30 people sitting in the lowest 3 pools!

One member of the staff was helpful in taking our photos (unfortunately, I didn't catch her name). My favorite are the optical paradoxes.  When the exhibit is best taken with two people on the photo she was nice to snap them for us and even suggests how we should pose. Many of the exhibits are intentionally designed for photography.

But it seemed like no one was around.  Since the door was open, we went in.  The scene looked like a massacre from a horror film with victims' body all over the place.  For some reason the police haven't been called yet and we suspect the killer is still here!  We must quickly find our way out before the killer finds us.HIT THE BULLSEYE-We loved how the locals can build an escape room themed around their business.-The mini sized strip club had the whole package from music to the stage to even the strip pole!-Although there was not much high tech in the room, the puzzles were still intriguing with old fashion locks.  The story line was closely connected with the puzzle designs.-It was our first time seeing a puzzle design revolving around articles of clothing. We thought that was clever.-Enjoyed the club music throughout the room.  We can visualize some players from a large group just enjoying the dance floor while others worked on puzzles.MISSED THE MARK-The first room fell a bit short on the decor.  The latter parts were a lot more immersive.-One puzzle was a bit time consuming but not sure of the relevance to the story line other than the visual connection.-Some props seemed like they needed a little updating.TAKE A SHOT?If you like solving crimes and collecting evidence, this could be a fun and unique experience for you.  We really didn't know what to expect for an escape room located in an adult shop, but we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the puzzles.  We recommend a group size of 3-4 people.  Since this place is open 24 hours, come join the party whenever you want!\"Mr. Grey's Red Room of Pain\"- We received a call from our friend Anastasia.  She apologized for not being able to join us on our night out, but her voice sounded weird as we heard a faint \"help me\" before the call ended.  We quickly rushed to Mr. Grey's state only to find her all tied up.  We must rescue her before Mr. Grey comes back!HIT THE BULLSEYE-This \"50 Shades of Grey\" inspired themed room was pretty on point with the chamber of secret (red room).  We really enjoyed the set design.-We couldn't help but chuckle through the room the entire time as they were definitely \"fun\" elements as you can imagine with this theme.-There was a good amount of puzzles in this room that even for enthusiast we felt satisfied at the end as the \"lock openers\"MISSED THE MARK-Music could've added to the intensity especially as time gets closer to finishing.-One puzzle was fairly difficult to discover.  It almost seemed like the only option is to ask for a hint.  The visual hint on the puzzle seemed to be worn out. Perhaps enhancing it would make it a bit easier.-We had opened a lock box prior to finishing a puzzle as it was possible to visualize it, but this brought the game out of sequence.  I wonder if there would be a way to leave the last pieces at the end to hinder that from happening or make it into a mag lock puzzle, so we have to find all the pieces.-A \"wow\" ending element could be added.  We were unsure if that was the end of the game or not when the final puzzle was solved.TAKE A SHOT?You'll want a larger group for this room.  It's best to designate a search team and a puzzle team.  This room is not linear at all so a large group can easily divide and conquer simultaneously.  We really enjoyed that aspect of the room as most of the time with just the two of us we were working on different puzzles the entire time.

Most of the ducks were hidden, and we weren't allowed to touch them or walk on the rocks in the yard, leaving a most awkward amount of space to venture.)

Parking is in front of his house, on a busy street, limiting the number of visitors, yet several families visited during the hour we did on Friday, March 31st.  It might be best for Dino Steve to revise his website to better reflect what he has to offer and specifically that it is technically not a \"park\"... it would be even better if he could obtain a grant to purchase the property next to his and transform it into a park or move to a separate area where the dinosaurs could be viewed more and enjoyed.

My mom would take EVERY visitor we had when we first moved here from Southern California here. And I used to HATE it. Now, as an adult, there's so much more to do and so many more amazing things than what it used to be 18 years ago.During the summer, they have a water sports rental area where you can rent kayaks, paddle boards, boats, etc. They also have a stage out on the water, too, where they tend to have live bands playing in front of a beautiful grass hill, which is perfect for a picnic or grabbing food to go (especially right now if you don't want to dine-in anywhere just yet). There's lots of cute places to shop, eat and drink. There's a delicious pizza place, gelato place and more! I think that gelato place was even around when I was a kid. Lots of memories there.The entire area feels like you are walking through Italy. It's absolutely beautiful. The only thing I will say is that we were with one of my friend's grandfather once and had to make our way down to the marina for the yacht and it was super hard to walk him down the uneven pavement all the way down, so be aware if you aren't completely able-bodied. There is a small parking lot off to the side by a sports shop though so that does make it a little easier. They also have public bathrooms a little around the corner from the ice cream shop, so you don't feel like you have to walk into a business just to use their bathroom.As I get older, I seriously want to move here so I can enjoy it all the time. It really feels like a beautiful little community. We even ran into some friends the last time we went and are looking to go back even this weekend again for some more kayaking.

Mom was bored, so I suggested a day trip to Nelson Ghost Town, which I had driven through before but never stopped at. Mom was all for it, so we jumped in the car, and off we went!Nelson is about 45 miles from downtown Las Vegas, so it takes about an hour or less to get there. It lies Five miles from the Colorado River. Originally called El Dorado by the Spanish, who discovered it in 1775, the town boomed thanks to Techatticup Mine. The area attracted a unique population because it was rich in gold, silver, copper, and lead. They were mostly Civil War deserters looking for a fresh start. This discovery started one of the biggest mining booms in Nevada's history.The town itself was named after Charles Nelson, a camp leader who was tragically killed in his home by a renegade Native American named Avote in 1897, along with four others.Downstream from Nelson, at the eastern end of Eldorado Canyon, was Nelson's Landing. This small village and port thrived on the Colorado River, where the canyon met Lake Mohave. Unfortunately, disaster struck on September 14th, 1974. A flash flood caused by heavy mountain rains swept through the area. Five channels from the mountains converged into a narrow outlet where Nelson's Landing stood, causing a wall of water and debris estimated to be 40 feet high. The entire landing and village were destroyed, tragically claiming ten lives, including Ted Ducey, a college basketball coach.Unsurprisingly, the Techatticup Mine was a hotbed of conflict. Labor disputes and ownership battles were frequent, often erupting in violence. Murder became a grim reality in this lawless town. Despite the bloodshed and the ever-present threat of floods due to its location, fortune seekers continued to flock to Nelson. However, the town's fate was sealed once the valuable minerals were depleted. Nelson became practically uninhabitable because it was located directly on the path of potential flash floods.Today, what is left of Nelson stands above the flood channels--a few scattered ranch houses, an old Texaco station, and abandoned buildings. However, the landscape has found a new purpose. Nelson's unique atmosphere has attracted photographers, music video producers, and filmmakers.  There is a US Navy fighter plane that supposedly crashed in Nelson, but it is not a real wreck! It was left behind from the scene of a 2001 movie called \"3000 Miles to Graceland.\" There are also plenty of other relics, including old cars, mechanical devices, old signs, and more.All the signs that supposedly discourage or threaten potential visitors are what cracks me up. But they are mostly a joke! Many first-time visitors take them seriously. Mom and I parked our car in front of the visitor center (That is what I call it!) and went in to pay. The lady there gave us a quick \"Do and don't\" shortlist and told us to have fun! They did not even charge us an entrance fee! The visitor center is also a museum. We spent about 20 minutes inside looking at the relics in there. The lady saw us interested, gave us a few hints about what to check around there, and even joked with us. We replied accordingly and had a couple of good laughs. Mom and I spent at least two hours there and had a great time. Mom started posing next to as many relics as possible, and I got it all on camera! By the time we got home in Las Vegas, it was getting dark, and we were still talking about what we had seen and our good times.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Apr 22, 2024"}, {"review": "Took a half day trip from Vegas out to Nelson to check out the ghost town.

So, when I popped into the store, I was given clear instructions about where to park and  what we could do until the hour of the wedding and was also invited in to wait on the comfy chairs, which is exactly what we did. The store has a lot of interesting old items that will either prompt conversation among your group or will keep you busy trying to figure out what some of them are.At one point, a couple of teenage girls opened the top freezer of a refrigerator and we saw a whole lot of rattlesnakes (frozen). We did ask and were shown that most of them had their heads cut off. I guess you do really need to be careful out there if you are on a tour of the area here!!

Once you get up, there are two booths where you can buy tickets or scan your vouchers. I HIGHLY recommend to buy a voucher in advance on Groupon the price per ticket is way cheaper than buying at the door. I believe $14 compared to $20 for adults (18+). Once you walk in you are greeted with huge \"Happy Chinese New Year\" sign and vibrant light settings all over the area. There's set ups of aquatic creatures, dragons, normal animals, and flowers. They also have a little historic description by each setting and how it applies to Chinese new year. I would say it's about a 2 acre lot. They also have food trucks that serve \"fair food,\" like funnel cakes, fried Oreos, and lemonade, I didn't have the chance to check it out.

Just a few families.I always love an arcade and love that you're able to drink and play video games, because I'm not the biggest gambler, but for some reason I enjoy this way more.

No tracking devices! Just you and those that are special to you. As you walk, ride, or bike enjoy that natural beauty around you. As of this last summer of 2022, Las Vegas is always short on rain; but we got a few rain drops that are going to make fall bloom here. The green is all around and flowers are already in bloom.

It seems so far away. Each morning the sun rises over the mountain lighting up the valley, a short drive and you are here in real time. Come up for a short day trip or stay over night at one of the lodges that are available up here.The area of Mount Charleston seems alien compared to the Las Vegas area. Who knew that so many pine trees are available here? Many of these pine trees have been standing for over thousands of years despite the neon that comes from the valley below. The landscape is unique as compared to the trails that have cut out here in valleys we hike. The mountain at one point is steep and can require some skills to climb. The top of the peak is around 11,000 feet. Make your way all the way up if you dare. Make sure and come prepared. Leave nature as you find her. Use caution when climbing and come prepared with water and food. The weather in this area can change and get to extremes in winter and summer. Check the weather often before you head out and explore. It's a great place for all those that seek serenity with nature. Bring the four legged ones too. The dogs loved the winter wonderland here. Make sure and bring the sweaters for the pups, they need to stay warm too. Let's go out and explore all your roads lead to fun here. Nature is calling will you come and explore. The mountain is great all times of the year. If your looking for adventure take the horse back tour and then eat to your hearts content at the lodge after a long day of riding.

A hostess came over once we walked further in and she explained what was going to happen and guided us to our table. The comp snacks and water was waiting at our table along with a menu of things we could order table side with our hostess. She checked on us after each fight (5 total) which only lasted a few minutes. We were stoked to see some of her favorite battlebots in person. The only drawback about our platinum seating was that we couldn't see the announcers and teams speak as they spoke directly to the general audience.  But the teams did make special runs past our section to high five us, which was cool. The backstage tour was cool cause you got to see just how damaged the bots were at the end of the night.

My husband likes the pepper, I don't lol) I also ordered the Philly cheesesteak but I haven't completely got to that yet because I'm already so full but I took a bite of it and man!!! I can't wait until my tummy is ready to eat the rest of it! HahahThe service is amazing! I seen the signs but I like to look at the menu before checking out places I've never been in before. I seen a post on our community Facebook group and the food looked amazing (they say eyes eat before the mouth and man, the photos made me hungry! Haha) so we decided to give it a try. The owner is super friendly! - With my job, I often become too busy to defrost food for dinner and it's not like we have the luxury of DoorDash here in Indian Springs, so I messaged the owner to see if maybe I could put in an order through fb and he gave me his number. I put in my order and it was ready when we went to go pick it up. We will definitely be ordering here again and often. My kids are so happy we don't have to drive 40 mins into town and then another 40 mins back home to buy soggy/stale pizza anymore.

We came for a a lunch in February (found it on google/restaurants in area search).  It is about 500 meters off the main drag and unless you are looking for it you won't know it is there. Friendly to out of towners, bikers, locals of course, and small business people passing through.

We were traveling to set the snow, the temple of sekhmet, and enjoy the scenery with family and I needed a bathroom while in the middle of nowhere.

I even felt compelled to wipe up the counters after a washed my hands and splashed because it was so clean I didn't want to leave a mess behind. Next time we're in town we're going to make sure to schedule time to stop and have a bite to eat. I bet their kitchen is clean and tastes like home cooking.

We opted for the fried mozzarella sticks, grilled cheese,  hamburger,  bacon cheeseburger, and western burger. Each came with crispy fries. The portion size of these burgers was pretty large. And nothing disappointed.It is quaint on the inside,  a few booths,  and a couple of tables. On each of the tables there is ketchup, mustard, salt, pepper and of course the napkins. The burgers don't come with mayo so if you need some just ask.Jennifer was wonderful, very personable and made this experience a great one. I love great customer service. Would def recommend- pricing  is reasonable.If your under 21 you can enter thru the restaurant side in the back, if not you can enter thru the bar side.

We hiked about a mile there and back without doing the loop. The rock formation was neat, and we saw some wild life too. My biggest complaint is the complete lack of signage.

The halfway point is where you'll find a couple of gems: a portion of a hacienda built in 1965 for a movie set called \"The Professionals\" - and - the slot canyon known as \"The Narrows\" at VOF (just missing the river!).The official start of the trailhead is at the end of the White Domes Road. Drive until you reach the dead end, which is also the parking lot and picnic area for White Domes. Walk towards the informational trail boards to begin the adventure through the beach sand. We thought about turning back in this section, because walking through sand with the sun beating down on us was a bit challenging. So glad the hikers alongside us gave us a pep talk, so we continued on. LOL. Happy to report we completed the trail (it was not all beach sand afterall) and we were able to snap some awesome photos. We spent about 40 minutes on the trail.A couple of observations:1) Saw a dog and his human climbing \"up\" the trail and thought nothing of it until we reached the end of the trail. We realized he was going the \"wrong\" way so that explains why the poor dog was panting so hard and why the human was gasping for air while climbing up through the rocks. Start from the top of the trailhead and everything will be fine. Not much panting guaranteed!2) Don't forget to look back at the trail and look up at the sky as you traverse, especially when in the slot canyon, to ensure you soak in all perspectives and overall beauty of the brilliant striations in the sandstone.Wear appropriate shoes. Bring water. Wear a hat. Time your potty breaks right. Watch your step, or else the reptiles will get ya! :-)A must visit!

I would suggest go from left entrance because sharp drop then gradually gain the elevation to original point. This way is better and less effort. It is about 1.25 miles round trip. The elevation difference is about 180 feet. It is not wheel chair accessible. The trail is at the end of the White Dome road. It is about 6.7 miles from the visitor center. You will see the loop ramp there will be the trail head. The view with large dome rock it the symbol of the awesome. Then you go down to the river bed and you will see a lot wind and water carve path way. Then you walk into a slot canyons. After the slot canyon, it is multicolored rock formations. The the picnic rock arch. Following a straight away trail back to parking lot. The trail is easy to handle. Along the trail was well mark and you will not get lost. It is definitely a must see when you visit the Valley of Fire.", "rating": "5", "visited": "May 26, 2021"}, {"review": "White Domes is a must visit when you come to Valley of Fire. There's a picnic area and restrooms near the parking area before the beginning of the trail. The trial loop is 1.25 miles long, the beginning is a sandy trail that eventually becomes rocky/gravel like. The mini slot canyon half way through the trial is a nice spot to take some cool pictures and the back end of the trail that leads back to the parking area has some great views with the mountains in the back ground. Son I real shaded areas on the trial so make sure to bring a hat and some sunscreen, and also keep an eye out for actual trail sign markers.
