It has been listed as one of the New Seven Wonders, and I think it's a must visit in Rome.

Definitely was one of the most anticipated attractions of my Italy trip. Booked tickets online ahead of time. In addition to GA tickets, there are also limited release tickets for the underground, arena, or attic. Was lucky enough to get tickets to the attic, which s the highest publicly accessible point in the Colosseo. Arrived early ahead of our ticket time to get in line and went through quite quickly since it wasn't overwhelmingly busy in the morning. Once we got inside, we were able to take a attic exclusive elevator upstairs where there were a series of stairs to go higher up. Best part is, due to the low quantity of tickets for the attic, there was less than 15 people in total with. Spread across a large exploration space, it made us feel like we had the Colosseo to ourselves. Impeccable views. As the time progressed, the GA areas of the Colosseo filled up so much that it was truly packed. Yet we still had the attic to ourselves. Highly recommend these tickets if you want to avoid crowds and experience the Colosseo in a perspective like no other.

It is remarkable that after almost 2000 years, it is still standing today, although it has been destroyed for various reasons over the years, mainly down to Earthquakes, it is still incredible to this day and even more incredible when you realise that this is just one-third of the original historic building.An entertainment venue for the Romans, it hosted gladiator fights and various forms of entertainment, today it's remarkable just to walk around the inside and outside and admire the beauty and remember the history of what once was.I do think the Colosseum is ruined to a degree by a plague which has infiltrated various forms of Europe - the scammers. It was impossible to walk for 60 seconds without having \"friendship bracelets\" thrown in my face or bottles of water and umbrellas, it truly didn't feel safe even in broad daylight so I would worry about solo female travellers in that instance, or even most people in general who may be prone to scams from the aggression of these people.Walking along the Roman Forum, and the streets of the Eternal City, the sight of the Colosseum just takes it to a whole different level and it is obviously a must-see when in Rome, but travel in groups! 4*", "rating": "4", "visited": "Oct 5, 2024"}, {"review": "ATTIC: They changed the website earlier this year and the process for securing the tickets became a bit different. We secured tickets for the attic at an early time - bright and early before the summer sun kicked in. An elevator takes you up and away from the crowd, and you get to explore the upper levels of the colosseum. There are more stairs as you go up, and gradually less open areas to explore but still breathtaking in all of its ways. Note that these steps are big, high steps. And there are MANY of them as you keep going up the floors. They will also be in the 1st and 2nd floor general admission area as well but not as many. It's much more quiet upstairs and rather enjoyable compared to the immense crowds downstairs where you can barely walk. Truly an incredible sight to marvel at. 1st and 2nd FLOORS: Many tour groups walking by with flags in the air and you're constantly weaving in between them and other crowds of people. There are vending machines with cold refreshing water for 1.5 Euros. We bought a few of those. Photo ops aren't incredibly hard to take.

There were some leftover, yes, so I have confidence that if you go online, you will be able to go but the tickets I wanted went super fast.The line to get in is intense so I would suggest you buy tickets online beforehand, the moment your desired date goes on sale.  If you can't get what you want and are willing to shell out double the price for a tour, I would suggest that as well.  And let me tell you, it's worth it to be near such a world recognized structure.  To me, it still doesn't feel real that we were there in real life.  The building itself is magical, even if you don't enter it.I will reiterate what people have said about being wary of pickpockets and scammers.  Usually, especially in other parts of Italy, we say no and they walk away.  This time someone got so aggressive with us that we had to half run away from him.  He did the thing where he threw the bracelet at my husband but luckily my mans knows not to touch so it just bounced off his chest to the ground.

I'll try and offer a fresh perspective. It's a surreal feeling to see a landmark firsthand that you have heard about and read about your entire life. To see it with your own eyes. If you're in Rome, you better not leave without seeing the Colosseum. Pro tip: if you're going during peak season, or a weekend, or really just to be safe, make reservations weeks in advance. If you don't, there's a good chance that getting tickets directly through the source will be impossible. If that happens, your only choice will be to get a ticket through a third party for a significant premium. Sure, you'll get a tour out of it but you'll be paying a lot for it. When you buy your ticket directly from the Coloseeo's website, you'll see several options. One has the options to walk inside the arena. I recommend this option. You'll be able to feel what it would have been like being one of the gladiators looking up at the crowd. There are some placards listing information about the Colosseum throughout the arena but for the most part just take in all of the sights from various angles and take a couple of pictures. After you've visited, come back at night. Once you do, you'll get to see the Colosseo lit up. It's a beautiful sight to see.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Sep 5, 2024"}, {"review": "Visiting the Colosseum was nothing short of amazing! I was truly in awe of the rich history surrounding this iconic landmark. Initially, I felt a bit anxious about the long lines and considered opting for a tour guide. However, I'm so glad I decided against it.We arrived around midday and encountered quite a queue for those purchasing tickets at the Colosseum itself. Thankfully, we bought our tickets from the official ticket booth located just across from the entrance, where the wait was only about five minutes. Once we had our tickets, we headed straight to the entrance for ticket holders, which had a minimal wait time for security.We also opted for an audio tour, enhancing our experience with fascinating insights. The total cost for two people was around 35 Euros (back in 2018), which included access to both the Palatine Hill and Roman Forum. I do wish the underground tour had been available, as it seems like it would have added even more depth to our visit.Overall, I highly recommend purchasing your ticket from the official ticket booth instead of being pressured by the scalpers. The Colosseum is a must-see, and experiencing it firsthand is unforgettable!", "rating": "4", "visited": "Oct 3, 2024"}, {"review": "The monument itself gets 5 stars ... it is as amazing to see as they say/pictures show. Unfortunately, 1 star is given for the experience. The tourism board can correct that, however they don't seem to care.First tip ... Buy your tickets in advance!! They sell out quickly and the greedy 'tour' operators will buy up all the tickets and then charge you double, or more, to buy the ticket from them. How does the city let them get away with this? We were approached by multiple 'guides' outside the coliseum offering us to 'skip the line' or to 'sell you tickets'. Luckily, we were able to buy tickets on only 2 days' notice through the website. Most days/times were sold out.Second tip ... Look through the ticket options. For only a few dollars more, if they are available, there are several better experience tickets available. There is one that allows you to take an elevator to the highest level of the coliseum called 'The Balcony' which we really wanted to do. This sells out quickly but is only a few euro more. There is also an experience which allows you to walk in the tunnels under the coliseum's floor. You'll need to get these early because they sell out fast.Outside the Coliseum there are African scammers walking everywhere. They will come up you and put a bracelet on your arm. When you take it off, they won't accept it and demand money. They can get very scary and aggressive. This really ruins the experience. One of them came up to my girlfriend and held out a bracelet, which he said is free. We knew not to take it but he kept persisting. I started to feel threatened and stepped in front of her. He threw the bracelet into my chest and demanded I pay for it. I put my fists up, ready to punch and he called me a name and walked away.Others came up to us and said, 'Nice shoes. Where are you from?' When we walked away, they started screaming, 'they hate black people'. Rome really needs to deal with this issue. It totally ruins the awe and wonder of seeing the Coliseum from the outside being swarmed with these people like mosquitos.Inside is incredibly crowded. You are getting bumped into and jostled by many people. Tourists have no real sense of personal space or tact and have no issue stopping lines of traffics while they take pictures of each other. My advice is to have a few alcoholic drinks before you go in to help you deal with the crowds.Once you are there, it really is amazing to see the size and architecture of this building. You can imagine what it was like when it was full and even though much of it is in disrepair, it is cool to think how long this building has stood. Our favorite part was standing near the floor and looking up at the stands, which was the same view that the gladiators had. It is amazing how much smaller it seems from the floor. When you are up high looking down, it feels much more huge.Overall, I hate to give 3 stars to such a magnificent building ... but the crowds, scammers, lack of bathrooms and ticketing need improvement.Last tip ... Your ticket includes access to the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill. The ticket is good for 24 hours. We visited the Coliseum late in the afternoon and then walked through the forum the next morning, right when it opened to avoid the crowds. The ticket runs for 24 hours, not a single day.", "rating": "3", "visited": "Jun 7, 2024"}, {"review": "Don't think this place really needs a review, but it is absolutely a must go when in Rome.

Instead of the usual cascading waters and glittering coins reflecting the Roman sun, the fountain stood empty, revealing its intricate stonework and majestic details in a way that's often hidden beneath the water.Without the rushing sound of the fountain, the atmosphere felt quieter, almost meditative, as visitors gathered to admire the exposed craftsmanship. The empty basin showcased the true scale of this iconic masterpiece, and it was fascinating to witness the dedication of the restoration team ensuring that the fountain would shine even brighter for the upcoming Jubilee celebrations.Though some travelers might feel a twinge of disappointment at not seeing the Trevi Fountain in its full glory, the experience of observing this monumental work in transition felt intimate and historical. It reminded me that Rome, in all its grandeur, is a living, evolving city. This temporary state gave a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the care and attention given to preserve its treasures for future generations.If you're visiting during a similar period, I'd suggest embracing the opportunity to see the fountain in a new light and imagining the bustling piazza when the fountain resumes its usual splendor.

This time, we actually made time to visit, and we were glad that we did. The palace was stunning.   It is a private mansion right in the heart of Rome on the Via del Corso near the Piazza Venezia.  When you look at it from the exterior, you realize how large it really is - it takes up a whole city block; and, the family still resides in the palace. We did make a mistake the day we were there - we did not realize that the ticket we bought covered both the museum and the apartments, and the apartments are only shown at specific times (which were not open that day).  So, they said that we could come back another day to view the apartments, which we did. We were able to walk thru at our own pace.  They do have free audio guides in various languages, and there is an elevator if you do not want to take the stairs.  There are four wings in the palace with a central courtyard. You will be stunned upon entering the first room - the Velvet Room with its rich reds and gold and covered with paintings from floor to ceiling.  The palace has extremely valuable works of art by some of the great masters: Raphael, Tiziano, Caravaggio, Brueghel the Elder, Velazquez and Bernini.The Gallery of Mirrors will take your breath away.  It was modeled after the namesake room in Versailles.  The mirrors were imported from France and when the light comes through the windows from the outside, you really appreciate it. The chapel is also worth a good look.  It was designed in the late seventeenth century by Carlo Fontana.  The chapel contains some interesting relics: the completely preserved body of St. Theodora and, supposedly, relics of one the soldiers who guarded Jesus during his crucifixion.The last room we entered was really interesting.  It was called the Aldobrandini room - sort of an off room - that looks like a massive warehouse.  It seems that years ago, there had been a massive blizzard that crushed the roof of the room. The walls were then concreted and remain so. It's unpainted and quite plain compared to the rest of the palace. This room is filled with a mishmash of paintings and garden statues. Make sure you do not miss the two Caravaggio's - one is \"Magdalene\" and the other,\" Rest on the Flight into Egypt.\" We did go back to see the apartments.  They certainly were opulent with beautiful paintings, chandeliers, sculptures and magnificent ceiling decorations.  Each room was stunning!  The Throne Room is named for the throne which, following an old Roman tradition faces the wall when there is no papal visit.  We were able to see the rooms that are currently being used by the family. We found interesting that the Cardinal/Pope had a stipulation in his original will that none of the artwork could ever be sold.

The three stunning fountains, including Bernini's masterpiece, the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, with its towering obelisk, create a serene atmosphere. The energy is lively yet calm, as street performers, artists, and small caf\u00e9s add to the charm.

It's so much fun to see the various types of fresh fruit and veggies available, many unique varieties. There was a type of radicchio I'd never seen before. And so many olives! But it's also challenging because you are limited in what and how much you can. It unless you are staying at a VRBO.Same with all of the olive oils, aged balsamic vinegars, pesto, jarred tomatoes, olives, regional pastas, meats and cheeses. OMG, I wanted it all!  Since I love to cook and mostly cook Italian, it was pure torture! I did buy Parmigiana Reggiano aged 60 months because the taste and price was too good to pass up. But I didn't have room in my suitcase - weight wise - to buy the olive oil, aged balsamic and other food items I wanted. They had the typical tourist souvenirs like scarves, aprons, ceramic bowls, and a wonderful assortment of olive wood charcuterie boards and serving utensils. I collect them but didn't buy any because the prices were the same or higher than what I find at Trader Joe's or Marshall's! And again, too heavy to lug back to the states especially if they aren't unique or a fabulous price.  There was even a stall selling a vegetable spiralizer like you see on late night tv commercials. He was demonstrating the plastic gadget and crowds were lined up watching. Cracked me up! Did you pick up any treasures while in a Rome? Yes, a plastic veggie spiralizer! Prices of many items were the same or higher than the shops. For example, a tiny bottle of 20 year old aged balsamic was $22 but $18 in a shop so know your prices and definitely try to barter.

You can really feel the history in the air--it's like stepping back in time.The dome is what really blew me away. It's hard to wrap your head around how the ancient Romans built something so perfectly engineered without all the technology we have now. The oculus at the center of the dome is mesmerizing. As the sunlight streams through, it moves across the walls and floors in this almost magical way. It's one of those things you could just sit and watch for hours--it really adds to the whole atmosphere.What I loved most was how peaceful it felt, even though it was bustling with people. The design makes the space feel open and calm, almost like it's alive but at rest. Everywhere you look, there's something fascinating to see, whether it's the intricate marble details, the enormous columns, or just the scale of it all.The Pantheon is also still an active church, which adds another layer of meaning to the visit.

Technically not in Rome since the Vatican is an independent state, Musei Vaticani was a 50-minute walk or so from my apartment (the buses were on strike the day I visited so I made the long trek). As you know, the major highlight at the Vatican is Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel. It's at the end of the museum, the icing on the cake so to speak, and you're not allowed to take pictures. Seeing the Sistine Chapel most definitely lives up to the hype. It's an elaborate and incredible work of art. And so is the rest of the museum. There's a massive collection of art here. You can easily spend hours, if not close to a full day here. Even as you're walking to the Sistine Chapel, the hallways have an impressive collection of modern art. Most people don't even look at these works of art. At other museums, this collection would be a highlight. Here, it gets overshadowed. Pro tip: reserve your ticket directly through the Vatican weeks in advance. I did a group tour. If you don't, you'll either pay a significant premium to get a tour through a third party or you'll wait in the heat for hours. Plan ahead and skip the line.

I had decided on a guided tour by a Vatican Museum docent and bought my ticket about a month in advance.

The tour lasted about 75 minutes and we proceeded through many rooms filled with art from the Vaticans' collection. It was quite impressive and I'm glad I booked it. The paintings in particular are  excellent. At the end of the tour you get to enter into The Sistine Chapel. Unfortunately they have a strict no photo policy inside and they also demand quietness. It was a beautiful room with incredible paintings on the ceilings and high walls. Many people sit and just look upward. Therefore it's hard to find any open seating. So most people stand in the middle and look up. You can stay in there as long as you want.

It's a little daunting but entirely fascinating.We went with a tour because we wanted to make sure we were going the right places, seeing the best things and experiencing the \"can't miss\" sites. I wouldn't recommend the tour we went on - it was overly large, the tour guide seemed a bit discombobulated and the breakfast that was included - with \"exclusive access to the surrounding areas\" for tour attendees - was not at all what we experienced. (And the breakfast was inedible. Our guide kept going on and on about the pancakes - \"get the pancakes, they're the best, you'll never have better\" - and they were awful. Also, each one of our tables were attacked by the pigeons hanging out on the patio. And yes, I mean \"attacked\", to the point where the manager was out furiously shooing the birds away with a towel and his arms. At least four of us ended up wearing the runny scrambled eggs on some part of our body as the birds brazenly swooped in to consume the meals we'd paid for, then in a haze of feathers and eggs flew off to the nearest railing, until our attention returned to our tables.)At any rate, I do believe the tour helped us get in, past the ticket line and security, but I don't think it helped more beyond that.

While built in the 18th century it only got so much attention after being shown in Roman Holiday where Audrey Hepburn's character meets Gregory Peck's character. The birth of the international slow food movement began as a protest to the opening of Italy's first McDonalds next to the Spanish Steps.Because it's considered the widest staircase in Europe it serves as a convenient and popular meeting point.

He had two assistants the day I was there; they were really nice and extremely helpful.I really learned a lot of things in this class that I will keep with me throughout life. The whole time we were learning, I kept realizing I had been cooking so many things wrong for so long. The food was delicious!

SomeItalians refer to it as La Macchina da Scrivere which translates to the typewriter! The structure is actually a conglomerate of several memorials. The Italian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier rests here, inside in the military themed museum. The goddess of Rome is also memorialized here and a tribute to the Adriatic Sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea are honored by fountains on either side of the Vittoriano memorial.

The church was built under Celestine I. He consecrated the basilica on August 5, 434 to the Virgin Mary. The tall, wide nave has an aisle on either side with a semicircular apse at the end of the nave. The Byzantine mosaics are stunning. They incorporate techniques from frescoes, paintings and mosaics from Africa, Syria and Sicily. The nave mosaics detail the Exodus of Moses and the Jews from Egypt.  The Athenian marble columns that line and support the nave may have come from the first basilica or from another ancient Roman building. They were cut to make them identical and are topped with gilt-bronze capitals. The 14th century campanile, or bell tower, is the highest in Rome. The basilica's 16th century coffered ceiling was gilded with gold. The gold was brought by Christopher Columbus to Spain and then presented by Ferdinand and Isabella to the Spanish pope, Alexander VI.Under the high altar of the basilica is the Crypt of the Nativity or Bethlehem Crypt. The crystal reliquary is said to contain wood from the Holy Crib of the nativity of Jesus Christ. The chapels off the aisles are so beautiful.

For those of us eating, we waited for the staff to tell us where to sit. We were the first ones upstairs that would be dining and a man I took to be a manager pointed us to a side front table of the eating area. Great! We liked those seats because we had a little privacy, more room, and my tall husband wouldn't need to worry about blocking anyone behind us.

I told her that we were directed there (and we did have reservations) but she wanted us to sit in the middle, second row, at a small table where we would have to sit side by side (not much room to to eat).

About 30 minutes in, one end of the table was served their food (delicious - everyone said so and I concur with the Shrimp Fried Rice and Yakamishi Gambero that I tasted). The other end of our table waited an absurd 45 minutes to be served. By that time, those who were served prior shared some of their food with those who hadn't been. My dish, Vegetable Tempura, arrived resembling fish sticks! I informed the female server that was hanging around that unless the dish was complimentary, I didn't want it. She asked me if I wanted it and again, I told her that if it wasn't free that I didn't want it and not to put it on the table. She put it on the table. That's when I saw that it was NOT tempura but panko-encrusted veggies served with a mayonnaise & soy sauce aioli (pictured). I bit into one of hard sticks and couldn't bite through it because it was the tough root end of the asparagus (pictured). Nice-turned-nasty Kamal (who was too busy serving all the other customers who filled up the small space to ever return to our table to check on us) finally showed back up and when I informed him of the exchange I had with the female server, he had the nerve to ask me if I was American! Trust me that it was definitely meant as an insult but it was laughable since he is Iranian faking a bad British accent (no shade/insult here because he actually admitted this back when he was nice to our party). The irony of his little sneer is that this establishment and his paycheck exists solely because of the only true AMERICAN music medium - Jazz. When we went downstairs to pay our bill, that same nice host now turned bartender tried not to comp the Veggie Tempura based on the fact that I ate it. The truth is that I picked through it because I was hungry but I didn't eat 3/4 of the dish because, as I told him, it wasn't tempura but panko-encrusted veggies. He chuckled VERY ARROGANTLY and acquiesced, removing the charge. There was never anything even near an apology for the poor service.THE MUSIC (which is why we came): The band was good and the singer (who mashed Jazz scatting with opera) was interesting & unique.All in all, I recommend this establishment for the music and the food (not the Veggie Tempura though) with the caveat that they don't appear to be American-friendly. They need to be aware that Americans are used to GOOD SERVICE AND THAT THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. They also should be mindful that based on these attributes, we actually TIP!

They were found and were raised by a she-wolf. Romulus eventually killed his brother and founded Rome on top of this hill and served as the first king of the Roman Empire. From the top of this hill you will see a spectacular and expansive view of Rome including the massive and impressive Colosseum, the Roman Forum and the Circus Maximus. You can see why those in charge chose the Palatine Hill for their palaces! In ancient times this was the most sought out neighborhood and became home to a series of rulers and other aristocrats. The word  \"palatine\" is the origin of the English word \"palace\" and the root of \"palazzo\" in Italian. Today the Palatine Hill is an extensive archaeological site where the ruins of the Flavian Palace and Stadium of Domitian can still be seen, along with the legendary Hut of Romulus. Recently they opened the House of Augustus and the House of Livia to the public and they are worth visiting for their well preserved frescoes. The Palatine Hill also has lots of grass and green space with wild flowers growing amongst the layers and layers of ruins. There are many walking paths, some covered in shade. Visit this peaceful green space to escape crowds and the blazing sun! Walking around the grounds is like an outdoor museum since  ruins are everywhere. You need a ticket to enter the Palestine Hill and tickets include entry into the Colosseum and Roman Forum also. It is easiest to book online and bring your printed ticket. If you choose to purchase in person, purchase it at The Palestine Hill ticket booth on Bia Di San Gregorio because the lines are way shorter than at the Colosseum.  You can do all three in a day, a very full day. Make sure to wear comfortable walking shoes because the ground is uneven and you cover a lot of territory.

There are walking tours to see all of the murals/street art. The \"Wall of Fame\" mural is located behind Via Ostiense (see videos included in this review)2.) Basilica of Saint Paul Outside The Walls (Basilica Papale di San Paola Fuori Le Mural) - Ancient basilica from 4th century, w/ the tomb of Saint Paul. This is a must-see basilica!

It is located on the top of the Capitoline Hill, overlooking the Forum.  You can access this via a back road or going further around to the front. Either way, you'll be climbing a lot of stairs. You come out into a plaza bounded by buildings on 3 sides. In the center is a replica of the large equestrian statue featuring Marcus Aurelius (the original of which is inside the museum). I think the buildings, like some other museums in Rome, was the former residence of some cardinal or official. You enter via the building on your right as you face the plaza.This was not covered by the city pass we'd bought, so we paid the ~ 15 Euros each.  We then had to do a bag security scan followed by checking our backpack at a locker station.Just beyond security, there is an open air plaza featuring sculptures, predominantly pieces of a monumental sculpture of Constantine. They have his head, hands, and at least one foot. You may have seen images of some of these before - I recognized them. The museum is extensive, but you can cover most of it in 2 hours.  There is a section with glitzy Baroque rooms and others with more medieval artwork.  We wandered through those quickly. The main draws (for us) were the sculptures. One large central room has the original equestrian statue mentioned earlier, the famous she-wolf suckling Romulus and Remus (the symbol of Rome), a boy pulling a thorn from his foot (you'll see this one in multiple museums), etc. They also had exhibits showing the foundation of a massive temple (to Saturn, I think) that was left intact. At the far end, they showed how early hut-settlements on the hills merged over time to form Rome. I'm sure I'm leaving out some things, but after several days of successive art / antiquity museums, it's hard to keep them all straight...There is a caf\u00e9 on the top level with an outdoor plaza, but its placement doesn't offer a lot of views of the city (it is on the wrong side for that). Otherwise it seemed nice. There is a basement passageway that connects the 2 main wings. From this, you can access the Tabularium, which is sort of balcony area from which there are great views overlooking the Forum. Our final stop was the other wing (on the left as you face the entrance plaza). It has a lot of busts of emperors as well as the Dying Gaul statue.

You know it's bad when a show features someone balancing bones for fifteen minutes. I wish I was kidding about that.I was thinking of being generous and giving it three stars but I don't what Cirque du Soleil throwing these sub-par shows at us and knowing we'll still go because of their name. Another thing is they were way too lax with people taking photos during the show They were even using flash! Not good! Not safe either. It's not cheap to see this show, but the Cirque de Soleil shows are usually worth it. Not this one.

And \"It's Not a Circus\" seems to be one of the lines that everyone pointed out but it sure didn't seem to be a strong attraction for me to go out of my way for.... Sounds like a performance made up of the performers from America's Got Talent.Then years passed and the name was still strong and recognizable but if it's in Las Vegas then I'm not interested (considering I think Las Vegas is over-rated but that's a whole another story).  Then a little more time passed and I hear Cirque Du Soleil has another nightly show in Orlando but still, that's far from South Florida and I'm no fan of the Tourist side of Orlando proper... But then, Cirque Du Soleil's traveling show sets up shop in South Florida to do a performance in Miami Gardens called Amaluna... and that's like in my backyard so I go... And I loved itFirst off... It's NOT A CIRCUS;  at least not in the traditional sense.I expected an indoor performance, like the buildings they do the shows in Las Vegas and Orlando... but when I arrived at the Miami Dolphin Stadium I saw what looked like an upscale, blue and yellow Circus tent(s) and when I entered the tent I was blown away... this was way more impressive than the tents we saw as kids going to the PT Barnum or Cole Brother Circuses (simple put they utilized the space purposefully and on-point).Snack stands and memorabilia counters were plenty and lines were short and the ones that did get a bit long moved along quick.  Although I will interject that the costs were high (for everything).Inside the main show area, it was pretty cool... The decor and props were ornate, modern, colorful with hints of industrial... When the show began the music kicked in and it's like performance after performance by individual people or groups but no intermissions or stage set up between majority of them... just an ongoing, upbeat performance.  Nothing blew me away as AMAZING but as a whole it was AMAZING... One performer that I managed to keep a vivid memory of:This one girl was standing straight up, very proper and very stiff and she simple extended one of her legs outward at a 90\u00b0 angle...  and I thought it's cute but any \"BEGINNER GYMNAST\" can do that... Then she extended her leg further moving upward until it was straight up and her body remained standing straight up (her leg was now at 180\u00b0)...  and I thought that's impressive but any \"PRIMA BALLERINA\" could do that (impressive but not knock my socks off impressive)...  But then her leg bent a bit and it looked like her foot was rubbing the back of her head...  and now I was finally like \"OH MY GOD\"...  I didn't know to be freaked out or turned on...

As you know, Cirque De Soleil is the famous name which comes to mind when seeing a entertainment show.  Previously, I had seen one show by Cirque De Soleil in Vegas that was amazing. Amaluna was no exception. This show was beautifully made with a talented team and beautiful choreography.  All the shows have a contemporary feel to them.  The performers do some pretty amazing things such as hand-balancing, going thru hoops in the air, different gymnastic moves etc.  Amaluna had a cast of 70 percent women which made it unique in that perspective.  My favorite act was the one they performed in a big waterbowl.  It was magical to watch.  Even though I'm very late in writing for this show which toured in Miami beginning of this year.  I still wanted to write this review because Amaluna is still currently showing in other countries.  They have show dates until 2016.

My sweet dear friend Shana said, \"We need to go to this!\"  And I'm so glad that I didn't listen to the naysayers - some of them my friends who've even posted \"naysaying reviews\" on this very site.  In the end, what I watched, heard and felt, was a very beautiful story of lives wrecked, but love found in an exotic paradise of wonders & whimsy.THE SETUPThe first Cirque de Soleil show I ever saw was the touring show of \"Vareka\", and I happened to catch it in the CalExpo parking lot with a similar tent \"Big Top\" set-up in Sacramento.  This current incarnation of \"Amaluna\" is part of the touring show that started in San Francisco in late 2013 and has now migrated to San Jose at the Taylor Street Bridge.  AMALUNA CREATIONThe Amaluna show premiered in Montr\u00e9al, Canada, on April 19, 2012, and is created & directed by Diane Paulus, one of the few Americans to rise high in the ranks of the Cirque de Soleil production realm.  Diane became Artistic Director of Theater & Opera of the American Repertory Theater (ART) at Harvard University in 2009, but she is probably best know recently for her nomination for the Best Director Tony Award for her revival of the musical \"Hair\".Diane and her hubby Randy Weiner co-founded a small theater troupe in New York City called \"Project 400 Theatre Group\".  Here they created avant-garde musical productions which merged classic theater and modern music, and their FIRST production was a rock version of Shakespeare's, \"The Tempest\".  The scouts of Cirque de Soleil looking for good source material from contemporary theater stumbled upon this gem and - flash forward some years - had her make an entire themed Cirque de Soleil event also loosely based upon this Shakespearean classic!THE STORYThus the story takes place on an island governed by moon goddesses (\"Ama\" = Mothers; \"Luna\" = Moon).  During a storm, there is a shipwreck and several men are washed up to this beautiful Island Paradise.  One of the divinity's daughter falls in love with one of the young men, and the trials that their love must endure make for the interesting chapters of contest that this production is all about.FUN FACTS*  I loved how the central part of the stage platform was like a giant daisy wheel (lazy Susan) that allowed it to revolve like a suspended carousel.  It is 25-feet diameter and weighs 6,000 pounds.*  Other than the carousel, the set design has very few moving parts allowing for focus to be on the performers. * There are 174 branches in 534 sections (90 in the canopy and 84 upstage) making a total of 1.1 mile of branches.*  The upper tent-top grid - that suspended all of the aerial artists and from whence wonders of light and shimmering beauty were dropped upon the staged - weighs 8,600 pounds and includes three acrobatic winches, each able to lift loads up to 400 pounds at 10 feet per second.  And in fact, I WAS amazed at how fast those 3 beautiful Moon goddesses shot up so fast to the center of upward top!  (There was also a cynical part of me that kept imagining, \"Christ.  What if that beast of a mechanism accidentally gets \"unbolted\" and crashes down to center stage?!?  But luckily THAT never happened)* The center acrobatic winch in the middle of the carousel can lift up to 1,000 pounds at 10 feet per second, and this certainly was tested when the Queen Lunar goddess invited the vocalist-cellist to sit amidst with her in her\"Sliver of Moon\" and play for the Island denizons.*  And how about that giant Fishbowl?  The bowl part alone is 5 feet 5 inches tall, 7 feet 3 inches in diameter, and weighs 5,500 pounds when filled with water.  But that was a beautiful scene when the moon daughter and the shipwrecked sailor acrobatically seduce each other atop, aside and INSIDE the fishbowl.  Loved it.LE COMEDYI almost feel guilty calling these talented individuals \"clowns\", but the talented duet - one a denizon female of the Island, the other the shipwrecked captain - find their OWN passion amidst very humorous scenarios that act as timed pieces to allow the aerial and acrobatic performers to rest up, grab a water, change costume, and than \"have at it\" again on the stage.THE LOWDOWNI really don't want to give too many specific details away about the performances since you really need to come see them for yourself.  But AMALUNA is a beautiful, majestic, and exquisitely exotic themed event that will dazzle you with it's beauty and love of aerial performances, exciting dances & lively music!", "rating": "5", "visited": "Mar 2, 2014"}], "reviews_count": "452"}

I wasn't just staring at pieces of artwork I don't understand the entire time.There's an outdoor portion and a courtyard so if you're planning on visiting during the cooler months, you might not want to check your jacket.

The bronze boxer is outstanding as is the version of the discus thrower here.  The busts of the various emperors and their wives are beautifully done and show much of their personalities.  But don't miss the third floor, which not only has spectacular mosaics but also reconstructed rooms with frescoes from the actual villa of Livia (wife and widow of Augustus).

Today, we are going to delve into the awe-inspiring Victor Emmanuel II Monument, a sight to behold in the Eternal City. While we may not have ventured inside its majestic walls, the allure of this architectural masterpiece and its captivating statues was enough to leave us breathless. So, tighten your shoelaces, pack your sense of wonder, and let's set out on this intriguing expedition!The Victor Emmanuel II Monument - A Grand Spectacle:As we strolled along Piazza Venezia, our eyes were drawn to the monumental white edifice that stood proudly before us - the Victor Emmanuel II Monument. Also known as the \"Altare della Patria\" or the \"Altar of the Fatherland,\" this imposing structure was built in honor of Italy's first king, Victor Emmanuel II, who played a crucial role in unifying the country in the 19th century.The Marvel of Architecture:Designed by the architect Giuseppe Sacconi, the Victor Emmanuel II Monument is a stunning blend of neoclassical and eclectic architectural styles. The colossal Corinthian columns and regal statues give it an air of grandeur that befits its historical significance. One cannot help but be in awe of the vast staircases that lead up to the central terrace, providing a captivating view of the city's splendor.The Equestrian Statue of Victor Emmanuel II:At the heart of the monument, a massive equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II stands tall. Clad in a majestic military uniform, the king's stern countenance seems to watch over Rome, reminding us of the legacy he left behind. It's as if time has stood still, preserving the memory of this revered historical figure.Guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier:Within the Victor Emmanuel II Monument, lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a poignant tribute to the soldiers who gave their lives for their country without their identities ever being known. The tomb is guarded solemnly by the military, and witnessing the changing of the guard is a ritual that echoes the respect and honor Italy pays to its fallen heroes.The Mighty Quadrigae Statues:Crowning the monument are two magnificent quadrigae statues, each depicting winged victories riding chariots pulled by four horses. The statues represent Unity and Freedom, symbolic of the unification of Italy and the birth of a new nation. These awe-inspiring works of art lend an air of triumph and valor to the monument.The Historical Significance:The Victor Emmanuel II Monument was constructed between 1885 and 1911, but its significance extends far beyond its architectural magnificence. It was envisioned as a symbol of Italian unity and identity, a testament to the country's journey towards independence. The monument's completion marked the 50th anniversary of Italian unification, making it a cherished piece of national history.Interesting Facts to Impress Your Companions:The monument houses the Vittoriano Museum, a treasure trove of historical artifacts and memorabilia from Italy's past.It is said that if you look closely, you can spot the statue of Emmanuel II's horse lifting one of its hooves. Legend has it that this is a sign of good luck for travelers.The monument's stark white marble was sourced from various regions across Italy, giving it a unique and captivating appearance.An Encounter of Architectural Majesty:As we stood in awe of the Victor Emmanuel II Monument, it was evident that this iconic structure serves as a testament to Italy's rich history and the enduring spirit of its people. Despite not venturing inside, the outside alone was enough to captivate our hearts and minds. The statues seemed to come to life with every angle, and the architectural brilliance reminded us of the ingenuity of the human spirit.Conclusion:As we bid farewell to this architectural marvel, we left with a newfound appreciation for Italy's past and an eagerness to explore more of Rome's historical treasures. The Victor Emmanuel II Monument is not just a structure of stone and marble; it is a symbol of unity, a monument of remembrance, and an embodiment of Italy's enduring legacy.

At the base of the monument, there is also an interesting museum that is dedicated to the unification of Italy and the early years of its history.You can enter free.  It's commonly called \"The Wedding Cake\" and \"The Typewriter\" by critics who protest its ostentatious design and its incongruity with the city's architecture. isn't it interesting...haha..The two fountains at either end of the monument represent the seas surrounding the Italian peninsula, the Adriatic Sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea.The Palazzetto Venezia building was moved so it wouldn't obstruct the view of the monument from Via del Corso.

This is the only one of the catacombs with an underground basilica, and the only one that still contains burial remains. My visit here made me wish I had planned to visit more of the catacombs in Rome. The frescos on the walls were in some cases surprisingly vibrant, and well restored (or on their way to being so). And it was really interesting to hear about the materials comprising the catacombs, and the particular properties of tuva rock that has helped keep the site in such excellent condition for nearly two millennia. The basilica is a site to behold; it's roof soars several stories above the floor of the space. I wish they allowed photos because it is just astounding.I would not hesitate to visit the Domatilla catacombs on a future visit to Rome, and would absolutely recommend them to anyone. This was a more fulfilling place to visit than the Coliseum. It may have helped that there was hardly anyone there when we visited--our tour had maybe 8 or so people, and there may have been one other tour before or after us, but it wasn't crawling with people inside and out. I was able to have a few meditative moments both within the underground basilica, and in the gardens outside. It was a really special time, to contemplate the history of the place, the religious significance and how this was a place built at a time when Christianity was in its infancy and its followers were subversive in their faith.I really gained a lot from my visit here, and I'm so glad that it's being well cared for to preserve this history.

It is more fun to explore I found, with lots of houses, caves and buildings that are all accessible to the public. There is a lot of information available on at each exhibit although I would recommend a tour guide if you are visiting here with little knowledge about the site. The amphitheatre is very impressive with much of it still intact, you must take time to see it if you are visiting here.

Ostia Antica is a splendid option and much more manageable than the vastness of Pompeii.The ancient port city of Rome, Ostia Antica is an easy metro ride from Rome. And all you need is a metro ticket to ride all the way so the trip is extremely inexpensive. The stop is only about a hundred yards or so from the gates of ancient Ostia...and sort of in the middle of nowhere, but signs point out the location. A couple of restaurants line the road in case you are hungry. There is also a restaurant located on the grounds of the ruined city and the food is actually fairly decent. A museum and bookstore are located near the restaurant also, but I wouldn't spend your time in the museum when the open air city is a museum in itself.Get a map...it is easy to get lost in the maze of ancient streets and you'll also want to know what you are looking at.Like Pompeii, large chunks of Ostia are still waiting for excavation, but what you can see? At the entrance you'll stroll past the columbariums (small pigeon-holed structures) which once held the cremated remains of Ostians. Yeah, first stop is the cemeteries which once lined the roads outside of Roman cities. Continue past apartment buildings, neighborhood baths with windows to chat with neighbors strolling by, a nicely preserved theater, the forum with its main temple, shops and cafeteria, private homes with their marble toilets. Truly wonderful.In winter, which is when I travel to Rome, Ostia can be virtually empty. Last time I was there, there were about five people and no guards. I was free to wander the backstreets at my leisure, even pausing once to kick at same grass and finding there was a beautiful mosaic under the turf and mud!!! Warning...give yourself time.

And the ancient toilets that are still there! It's so cool how the ancient Romans used aqueducts for their water needs. The opulence of the buildings can be seen today still. There was a lot of decoration used on the buildings and the buildings themselves were a work of art. A lot of the public buildings had commerce on the main level and then living quarters above. There's little signs on the paths that help direct you around to the different parts of this town. It was much larger than I had originally figured and the walking tour around the city took us a couple of hours. They have a little cafe to get food and drink and a nice place to sit and enjoy it either inside or out on a patio. There's a gift shop too. There's a particular book in this shop that caught my eye. It has overlay pages included to show you what a ruin looked like in its heyday. They include a picture of the current ruin and then you lay the transparency over the top to see what it historically looked like. This is super cool for visual people.

Their presence in Rome predates Christianity. It is probably the oldest continuous Jewish community outside of the Israel and the Middle East. Written records trace the Jewish community as early as 161 BC when Judah Maccabee sent envoys to Rome.For hundreds of years, Jewish families coexisted with their neighbors. They worked as bakers, butchers, physicians, money lenders and craftsmen. As the friction between the papacy and the Jewish community in the 1500s escalated, walled off Jewish ghettos were created following the model in Venice.The Roman Ghetto was established as a result of Papal bull Cum nimis absurdum mandated by Pope Paul IV on 14 July 1555. The bull required that the 2,000 Jews who lived in Rome at the time to live in the ghetto, which was not only walled off, but the gates were also locked from the outside at night to keep them in. The Jewish community was also forced to pay 300 Roman scudi for the construction of the wall and gate. The location was prone to flooding and quite undesirable. By the late 1580s, roughly 3,500 inhabitants were living in inhuman conditions. During the plague of 1656, 800 of the ghetto's 4,000 inhabitants died.The bull revoked almost all the rights of the Jewish community. It placed many restrictions on Jews including prohibition on property ownership (even within the ghetto), not being allowed to provide medical care to Christians and compulsory Catholic sermons on the Jewish Shabbat.Life in the ghetto was harsh filled with poverty, epidemics, such as plague, cholera and malaria, diseases due to lack of fresh water and overcrowding. Roman Jews were limited to unskilled jobs such as pawn brokers, fish mongers or ragmen. Many Christians hated the Jews because they were allowed to \"lend\" money throughout Rome and Europe.  Jews had to wear a yellow cloth if they left the ghetto. The yellow veil worn by Jewish women matched the color worn by Roman prostitutes. During Christian feasts they were forced to run naked or be ridden by the Romans as a way to entertain the Romans. They had to petition for the privilege annually to live in their homes and swear loyalty to the Pope at the Arch of Titus which celebrated the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70 AD.As in most of Rome, there was no fresh water in the ghetto. When the Pope decided to use the old aqueduct system to provide fresh water via a series of fountains designed by Giacomo della Porta, a fountain was due to be placed at Piazza Giudea, the site of a market, inside the ghetto. However, Muzio Mattei used his influence to have the fountain, the Fontana delle Tartarughe (Turtle Fountain), located in the Piazza Mattei instead in front of his residence. Outraged, della Porta changed the design of the fountain so that it provided a small trickle of water to the Mattei family. In 1888, the ghetto walls were torn down. In 1904, the Great Synagogue of Rome and a number of apartment buildings were erected on the site. The Roman Ghetto was the last remaining ghetto in Western Europe until ghettos were reintroduced by Nazi Germany in the 1930s.Today, the Jewish Quarter is a thriving community filled with delicious Kosher restaurants, street musicians and shops. The Great Synagogue in Rome has a very visible square dome and a Jewish Museum. Look for the stumbling stones scattered along the cobblestone streets that remember Roman Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust and a tribute to Stefano Tache Gay who was murdered at the age of two as the synagogue was attacked on Shabbat in 1982.Sit at a sidewalk cafe for lunch or dinner. Try the Jerusalem artichokes and pistachio crusted sea bass at Renato al Ghetto and the pizza and pasta at Ba'Ghetto Milky. Delicious!

We were on an adventure, and we did find them.  What is really fascinating is to understand the \"Why.\"These plaques are engraved and were placed to tell the story of who lived here, their name, where they were arrested and what happened to them.  It was the idea of a Berlin artist, Gunter Demnig, back in 1993.  His goal was to commemorate the lives lost by Jews, Roman gypsies, political prisoners, homosexuals and others to German National Socialism and the Nazi concentration camps of World War II.

The Jewish ghetto of Rome has changed tremendously, so taking the tour through the Jewish Museum was a wonderful way to understand what was. The historical events and facts will sadden you and blow your mind; take note of the Solpersteine- tiny gold squares in the sidewalks in front of many of the buildings, reminding us of the Holocaust victims that lived in those very buildings and never came back. But not all is heavy in this historic ghetto; the museum and the synagogue are fabulous. As I walked through the streets and heard the school children singing in Hebrew, my heart swelled. My nose was filled with the smells of delicious kosher Italian food (I love witnessing the joining of cultures and enjoying the culinary results!), and soon my belly was full, too. I definitely recommend a visit to this neighborhood but I'll reiterate that a bit of help to understand what you are looking at is a must.

We reserved the Rome 3 days package with RIL which included a Civitavecchia port pick up, 6-hour tour of Rome on day 1, 3-hour Vatican tour on day 2, and 6-hour hidden Rome tour on day 3. For day 1 & 3, we had the pleasure of experiencing the city of Rome with our driver Peter. His skillful driving and ability to provide detailed guidance on all areas enhanced our visits. Peter was also very accommodating and kind. We are thankful for his willingness to accommodate our post-cruise fatigue, as he offered to adjust our day 1 tour time length to allow for more rest & moved the unused time to day 3. He also provided advice on when would be the best times to visit the busiest sites in Rome..as a result we were often able to beat the crowds. Always early, organized, and attentive to even the smallest of details, we were able to truly experience Rome in 3 days what could have taken others a week or more to do.For our private 3 hour walking tour of the Vatican, we were fortunate to have Alessandro as our excellent guide. He was very knowledgeable about the museum, church, chapel, and art. His enthusiasm and genuine interest in the art throughout the Vatican made our overall experience more meaningful. His familiarity with the museum made navigating its crowded halls easier, as he was able to request accommodations from the staff for my mother (who has difficulty standing for long periods). He was always willing to take our picture and provided a map & excellent recommendations for food and gelato after our tour finished.My family and I cannot thank Peter, Alessandro, and RIL enough for all of the wonderful experiences we had during our 3 day stay in Rome.

That will kill your feet!We had Franco guiding us and Federico driving. RomeInLimo thinks of everything - bottles of water for you, mobile phone to call for pickup when you are done seeing a sight and they also took us to the best restaurant you can imagine for lunch! They really care for you to see all the sights, even if you are behind schedule they make sure you'll get to see everything. And don't be afraid to express your own wishes!To use this service one of the first days in Rome was a great tip we got from a reviewer at another site, that way you can return by yourself for the sights you missed or want to see again. Also, buy the tickets in advance for Sistine Chapel, Colosseum and Palantino Hill. It will save you valuable time. Unfortunately it is not possible to save time the same way going up in the St Peter's Dome. (Queuing and climbing can take 60 mins) Bare in mind that Colosseum, Palantino, Sistine, St Pete's dome eats time from your paid service.

Dedicated in 315 AD, the arch was built by the Senate to commemorate Constantine the Great's (aka Constantine I) victory over Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge (Ponte Milvio in Rome) in 312 AD.Despite its dedication to Constantine, the arch is actually decorated with a mix of 2nd century reliefs and art from earlier monuments dedicated to Trajan, Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius. There are three archways with the large central one being over 37 feet (11.5m) tall. Above the archways is an \"attic\" which has the brickwork covered in marble. A staircase closed to the public is inside the arch to get to the attic.The large inscriptions dedicating the arch to Constantine are still visible at the top of the arch although the bronze that was originally there is long gone. A pair of smaller latin inscriptions \"LIBERATORI VRBIS\" & \"FUNDATORI QVIETIS\" in the central archway translate to \"liberator of the city\" & \"founder of peace\" hail Constantine not as conquering Rome, but freeing Rome from occupation.There is little around the arch to provide historical context or enhance the tourist experience of seeing Arco di Costantino. Even adding signage point to an app or website with an audio guide or information would be helpful. Regardless, the arch is a fantastic attraction and photo opportunity that shouldn't be overlooked.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Feb 29, 2020"}], "reviews_count": "35"}

Not the most necessary thing to see since it's out-of-the-way from Main areas and walking distance. But definitely worth it to see.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Nov 24, 2024"}, {"review": "Visited The Aventine Keyhole (TAV) on Saturday 10/01/2023 (around 12:10pm) while in Rome, Italy for the 1st time, and being the kind human being that I am ;), here are a few helpful tidbits for anyone else, who is considering of adding a visit to TAV to their itinerary. For those who don't know, The Aventine Keyhole is also known as the \"most famous keyhole\" in Rome and is located on top of the Aventine Hill, which is one of the 7 ancient hills of Rome. Helpful Tidbits: - - - what is it? literally is a tiny keyhole located on a door that you look through, that then gives a perfectly framed view of the St. Peter's Basilica located in the Vatican City (see pic attached in this review of our poor attempt of trying to capture a photo of the beauty that you see through that tiny keyhole) - - - how long? cost? the experience of looking through the keyhole itself, only lasts a few minutes and depending on when you visit, you'll most likely will be spending more time waiting in line until it's your turn to look through the keyhole. This is a \"free-99\" thing to do so very budget-friendly! - - - amenities: (things that make you comfortable & at ease) : *  no restrooms/toilets onsite to use so make sure you \"go\" before you get to TAV. *  there are no shade trees to protect you from the sun while waiting in line & no seating once in line because you'll be standing in an actual parking lot area (see videos/pics included in this review of the line we waited in during our visit & to show what the surrounding area looks like) so just be prepared w/ your sun hat, sunscreen, water, ect. *  on the day we visited, there was a food truck onsite that sold drinks and food (not sure if they are always onsite) so we were able to buy some cold water and a few other snacks items to keep us busy while we were waiting. No cards were accepted as payment (see pic included in review of the food truck). - - - kind human PSA: if there is a long line of people during your visit, please don't be one of those self-absorbed & rude people who takes their sweet time at the keyhole w/out any regard for those behind you, who are patiently waiting their turn. Thankfully, during our visit, it wasn't very crowded so we didn't have to experience this but I can definitely imagine how crowded & busy it can get w/ this being the \"most famous keyhole\" in Rome. :) - - -  nearby sights of interest w/in walking distance of TAK: I wouldn't recommend a visit to The Aventine Keyhole solely by itself since looking through the keyhole only takes a few minutes to do but I do recommend that you also visit the other nearby sights that include ... 1.  Basilica di Santa Sabina all'Aventino (church dating to 422 A.D.) Definitely a must visit! So much history! And one of my favorite basilicas that we visited. 2.  Giardino degli Aranci (Orange tree garden w/ scenic view of St. Peter's Basilica) free to visit, water fountain located in garden, and bench seating to relax on while you enjoy the scenery After my hubby and I were finished w/ our keyhole experience, we than just explored at our leisure, the nearby area on foot, while taking in all the beautiful and scenic views. Getting to see so much rich history up close that Rome is famously known for, really was a privilege and I'm so very grateful that we were able to have this experience.

You pass by several beautiful gardens on the way and do yourself a disservice if you do not walk. There's a gate and if you look through the key hole you can see a beautiful garden with trees which frame St Peter's Cathedral right in the center. It is truly an amazing sight.

It sounds crazy but in the piazza there's a gate and if you look through the key hole you can see a beautiful garden with trees which frame St Peter's Cathedral right in the centre. It's quite magical. I have uploaded photographs but it has to be seen to be believed. Locals bring their visitors here to admire the impressive optical effect created by Piranesi. It doesn't sound that wonderful; some trees and St. Peter's, but few leave uncharmed. Located in the artistic and enigmatic Piazza dei Cavalieri di Malta, a gate bars the entrance to the Priory of the Knights of Malta. Queue up to have a look through the ornate keyhole, and you'll see the Vatican's vast white cathedral floating at the end of a symmetrical tunnel of trimmed trees. The piazza is placed on the Aventine Hill (Aventino), which is a nice tranquil place to stroll on a sunny day.

She and her husband Petro own this company.Even if I didn't I would write a five star review for their tours becuase of the personal attention they give. It can be really expensive to take a shore excursion so you can book through the crusie line and pay or you can take your chances, you can take your chances with the tour operators you meet on the dock or you can do it on your own and hope you get back to the ship on time. They offer two tours. One is a walking tour in Rome. They meet you at the train station, take you through the sites of Rome-the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, Vatican Museum, etc..If you want to go into the Vatican Museum you have to pay the entry fee, but you won't have to stay in line. Sometimes it can be really long. I remember waiting at least forty minutes to get in on my own. The great thing is that they know the city well enough that they guarantee your on-time arrival. Which is great since I have been lost in Rome, and though it is beautiful it can be a little distressing. Just so you know, the busses run differently on Sunday..They also offer a tour -Naples, Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast. For this tour they meet you at the dock and then take you in around in a bus showing you the beautiful sites.I haven't been but to Naples, but I can not wait.Oh and they are cheap. The Rome tour costs 59Euros and the Naples cost 65 EurosYou get licensed English speaking guides who know the cities. I love that I can always get a good recommendation on where to get good gelato.

We had an awesome speaking Italian native named Vincenzo who had a killer accent and a love for Italy.

CBM met us at dockside and directed us to a full sized tour bus that took us to a parking lot just outside of the piers.  Evidently, the pier at Salerno is still trying to figure out how to get passengers off cruise ships.  We then drove the bus to the Amalfi Coast with our great tour guide, Gus.  Got a chance to look out over the Med and view the towns along the coast.  We then drove to Sorrento and had lunch at a nice restaurant and then had some time for shopping downtown.  Afterwards, our bus drove to Pompeii and had a good visit at the ruins.  Saw enough with the local Pompeii tour guide so that I didn't feel like I missed that much for such a short visit. The only problem we had was when we returned, the bus drove us to the dock where there was a big traffic jam and Gus suggested that we could easily walk to the end of the pier to our ship.  Unfortunately, the security guard at the pier said it was too dangerous to walk because the driveway was too narrow.  We finally managed to get back on the bus and eventually got back to the ship.  Based on everything I heard, I suspect that the port at Salerno needs to get this sorted out and that CBM did the best they could.  When our cruise ship arrived at the port of Civitavecchia, we did not realize that CBM expected to meet us at the train station to go to Rome.  This was not clear to us when we booked on-line with CBM.  By the time we made telephone contact and met CBM at the train station, our small tour group had left an hour earlier.  CBM made up for the error by traveling with us to Rome on the train and connecting us with John for a great private tour of the city.  We went to the Colisseum, sat on the Spanish Steps, threw coins into the Trevi Fountain, went inside the incredible Panthenon, drank espresso, visited various plazas, sat on the sidewalk outside the Vatican walls and ate super yummy pizza from a tiny local pizza joint, and waited in a fast moving line at St. Peter's Square for entry into St. Peter's Basilica.What made the CBM tour different was the use of subways and buses to get around.  Saves both time and money.  We met up with our small group at the train station to return to the port.  Unfortunately, construction at the Citavecchia port forced us to walk about 15 minutes from the train station to an entirely new shuttle bus lot to return to the ship.

Petro met us first at the train station (which was very easily navigated to through the cruise ships bus for something like 2euro). Some people were late getting to the train station in Civitavecchia so a second staff member stayed behind to wait for them. Petro boarded the train with us and told us where to get off in Rome. A woman on the tour forgot her bag on the train and Petro ran insanely fast back to the car, asked the train to wait and got off the train with the woman's bag, just as the doors were closing. Im sure she was very grateful! I was impressed! There were two other guides waiting for us there. We split into two groups. I was in the larger group of 20 ppl. Compared to the cruise ship tours of 20+ I was delighted to have less people to travel with. Our guide Stefano was wonderful! When we were at the Colosseum, Petro appeared again with the late arrivals so they could join our group. What I thought was exceptional was that they were able to insure the late arrivals were taken care of, without making everyone that was on time wait for them. This is what I mean by above and beyond!! All day we got in and out of the sights quickly as Stefan departed a wealth of knowledge on us. Petro seemed to go ahead and get our tickets, scout lines and I know he was traveling back and fourth between the two groups they had running in that city that day. This extra person managing everything is what made everything run so smoothly. The place Stefano recommended for lunch was the best food we had on our trip and they had free wifi! In addition hopping around Rome entirely on public transportation worked extremely well. We avoided traffic and maximized our time. We heard that several groups that went into Rome with the cruise line that day were not able to get in to see the Sistine Chapel- not a problem for us. We took the train back to the port and were back to our boat with plenty of time to spare.

I'd say you need an hour at minimum to walk around and take in this UNESCO World Heritage Site.  I highly recommend buying your tickets in advance!  We literally booked at midnight exactly one month prior to the date we visited. Book using the official Colosseum website! Not a \"third party\" site that will jack up the costs! Purchasing in advance also allows you to \"skip the line\" which is HUGE when it comes to European sightseeing in general. My wife and I paid 18 Euros per person for access to the first and second levels of the Colosseum (as well as access to the Forum and Palatine Hill).

And the lines to buy tickets, can be verrrry long so definitely pre-book your tickets (you can do it online via the Colosseum website or via a few online retailers who handle the sales). You can buy either regular tickets, skip-the-line tickets, or an actual tour. I recommend one of the second two options above, as a ticket by itself will still mean long entrance lines and no guided information as you go. With skip the line, you at least get in much quicker. But the best way to see it is via a tour, where you're with a group and have a guide who will explain each thing you're seeing. We did the Colosseum tour with Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum and it was only about $30 USD each, so definitely worth it when a plain ticket itself for the Colosseum is $20. These can also be booked online with many different vendors, including the actual Colosseum website.I won't get into the different things you'll see when inside the Colosseum, as that will depend on which ticket you buy (you can do only the upper level, both levels, night tours etc).

For example, if the whole route has 10 stops, you are at #4 and you would like to go to #2, you have to go to #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #1... then arrive at #2. The buses don't go backwards. So you have to plan your day according to the map/route they provide. Or else you will be wasting a lot of time sitting on the bus. On the brochure, it states that buss depart every 10 minutes.

Yes, it's expensive. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Let me repeat, book it with the breakfast you won't be sorry. We arrived at the crack of dawn, and there was already a line waiting to get in for the breakfast/Vatican tour. Like every place in and around the entire country, it's walking and more walking. If you're not prepared, wear comfortable shoes. Shoes make all the difference. Once inside, we were ushered from place to place, until we got to the actual check-in counter, and produced our reservation slips and passports. We were then ushered into another group, and handed headphones of sorts and waited for a tour guide.A great tour guide, especially with this end of the tour, is essential. Unfortunately, you don't get to pick your tour guide, you're just put into a group. More about the tour guide later. If you are religious, this place will totally speak to you. If you are not religious, this place will totally speak to you. If you are completely against religion, this place will speak to you. It's almost like it's the ninth wonder of the world. Walking through history Should tug at your heart strings, make you think, make you wonder, and truly make you feel.The benefit of the breakfast tour, is that no one else is walking through the various connected buildings, so you pretty much have the ability to take in the amazing collection of art and history without the huge crowds. I will say, it is still a tour, and as someone in a tour, be courteous of those around you. It was incredibly frustrating that other people would stand in front of some thing that the rest of us either wanted to see, or take pictures of, and there was no care or consideration for others. This is definitely an experience that almost becomes indescribable. The history that is encapsulated within the Vatican walls, the historical value, the sentimental value, the monetary value is pretty, staggering. With the Vatican has its own country, it is absolutely protected with armed forces in and around the entire country. Understandably, with the pope living there, it makes sense, but what they are really protecting are the assets.Oh, to look at artwork that is centuries old, like I said, it's walking through history. These are pieces and places that I have read about since I was a kid, and to actually see these things up close and personal is pretty overwhelming. One of the few places that we were not permitted to take pictures in, was the area that the picture of the last supper.  It's grander than I expected, it's larger than I expected, and it is far more detailed than I ever expected.Our day started out with the guided tour, and we made our way through all the different rooms and displays, and by the time that we were done several hours later, it was time to go have breakfast. If you opt for the breakfast tour, I highly encourage you to grab a little nosh prior to your tour. You absolutely will be starving by the end of the tour.Breakfast is served outside under a somewhat enclosed caf\u00e9. Based on pricing, it seems to be a much better deal as a package than to purchase things from the menu individually. The servers aren't very friendly, but the portions are generous. What I really enjoyed, was the fact that we could sit and enjoy our breakfast, and we were not ushered out or asked to be done by a time certain. It's one of the things I love about Italy. Everyone recognizes the art of just being.There usually is an opportunity to see the Pope at least once during the week, but I would not plan your tour around that opportunity, because much of it depends on his current health. Plus, it just increases the crowds which really grew our by hour.

The property is too big for you to go back to the area you wanted to take more pictures of or just to sit and take it all in.  Make sure to have insect repellent on if you're prone to being bitten.If you have walking difficulties,  this may not be the best option as the grounds were built before there were wheelchair ramps.

Secret Food Tours offers three-hour long tours that take you on a gastronomical adventure throughout the heart of Rome. This experience is more than just delicious food, which is what makes Secret Food Tours so unique. The tour explores Piazza Navonna, a city square ripe with history, as well as the Campo Dei Fiori Market, offering sightseeing as well as culinary escapades. Along with four other visitors, we embarked on a daytime tour, which started at an intimate caf\u00e9 in Piazza Novanna.  Our tour guide Tomasso was a local Italian and incredibly knowledgeable about the city square and its rich background. Here, he introduced us to the finest Italian coffee, freshly brewed for our group. I sipped a cappuccino, which alerted my taste buds with rich, full-bodied flavor and an airy foam. I was awake and eager for the next stop. While enjoying three different types of real Roman style pizza at Forno Campo de Fiori, our tour guide made us feel so welcomed. He took great pride in his city, and it showed in his passion for both the locales and the food. Next we stopped at a specialty shop, known for fried balls of risotto, called Suppli, which basically solidified my trust in anything this delicious city had to feed me. Crispy on the outside, warm and creamy on the inside. I was excited to visit the Campo Dei Fiori Market, which as our guide informed us is the oldest market in the town. With so many fresh and beautiful vegetables, it's easy to see why the food in the area is incredibly tasty. I was pleasantly surprised to do some sightseeing during the tour, as we got to see some of the Roman ruins that dot the city and here a few stories of the many narrow streets. Whether it was Carbonara near the Jewish Ghetto, amazing cannoli at a legendary bakery, and salty Italian hams, salamis, and cheeses at 'Beppe', our guide always made us feel like locals. We ended on a sweet note with the most refreshing gelato. Our tour guide was so fun and friendly, and the food was exquisite.

We met in the Piazza Navona and had a fabulous walking tour of Rome through off the beaten path streets and passageways. Alphonso was knowledgeable and very accommodating to the various needs of the group. There were 11 of us in all and we had multiple stops. We started at the Piazza Navona itself for espressos, juices, or cappuccinos which were delicious and began a 3.5 hour foot tour of the areas. We stopped for Roman pizza and tried three varieties, of which the margherita was my favorite, but the potato and rosemary was an interesting surprise. Our next stop was a cheese shop where we tried some super creamy burrata and a smoked mozzarella which had the flavor of hickory! More local flavor history was imparted by Alphonso and then we went to a restaurant specializing in Suppli, or roman fried rice balls (which we improperly think of as arrancini here in the states--the differences were explained.) We tried two different ones here and got to try a nice wine with it. We stopped by a traditional food market in the Campo del Fiori and got to see the amazing selections of produce, meats and cheeses the locals can shop for. Then we went to a traditional bakery where we tried these tiny little cannoli. Very good! Next was a stop for two kinds of pasta: a traditional carbonara with guinciale and a rigatoni amatriciani. These were served with pitchers of red and white wine. Next we were off to a high end cheese shop where we tried a delicious Italian white wine and sampled four different cheeses. Some of these were very strong! Our last stop was one of Rome's most acclaimed natural gelato. They were filming a television segment there when we arrived. We got to try two different gelati and they were great. I had another tour booked for 3 so we had to eat and run. Alphonso was super great and called a taxi to pick us up at the gelato shop. I was very satisfied with our tour guide and the food. My only wish was that there had been a bit more meat or fish and produce to eat among our choices.

Michelangelo spent four years to paint this masterpiece. There is so much details and the walls look 3D. Even the crest that Michelangelo requested is a small detail that one cannot overlook when visiting. When you enter, they ask you to be respectful by being quiet and not taking any photos so I have no idea how Yeeps posted photos of this place! Some are blurry so I'm guessing they snuck them in. It's crazy to think they would risk doing that with the amount of security and cameras around the chapel. I'm amazed at how every inch of the place is done with so much thought and detail. It was smaller than I imagined it to be in real life but it's still spectacular. When you finally reach the Calpella Sistina, you know you're about at the end of your visit to the Vatican Museum. You can exit to the left if you came alone or you can take the door on the right to St. Peter's Basilica if you booked a guided tour. We thought that was the exit when people were going through that door and found out by security the hard way lol.

Must do in Rome!", "rating": "5", "visited": "Oct 28, 2024"}, {"review": "It's a masterpiece for a reason! The ceiling and walls are adorned by many, many individual frescoes, a very difficult art form where the pigments are washed into the plaster. It was a discipline that a Michelangelo didn't like and he actually had no interest in painting. However he was ordered to paint it by Pope Julius II so between 1508 - 1512, Michelangelo dedicated his days and nights to painting the frescoes. The result is spellbinding. so much going on, so much to take in!That being said, with the crowds and the small space, it's not always easy to get up close and personal with the art. There are benches along the edge and if a space opens up, go for it. I found that this was the best vantage point to view the art, by staying in one spot and letting my eyes gaze around the walls and ceiling. Since the Sistine Chapel is an actual chapel, which is a sacred place, that means no photographs or videos. It also means silence as in no talking. Whispering is NOT silence! Even though they tell everyone before entering, and there are signs everywhere, and the guards make repeated announcements, obnoxious people just ignore the rules. Don't be one of them, it's disrespectful. Both to the sacred nature of the chapel and to all the others that are here to experience this incredible body of work. The chapel is very small and with everyone talking it was so loud making it near impossible to appreciate the art. For the few minutes when there was silence immediatelly following the guard's announcement, it was a beautiful place of meditation and art appreciation. Until the obnoxious people all started talking again.To set expectations:- The Sistine Chapel is at the far end of the Vatican Meuseum. The museum is filled with gorgeous tapestries, painted ceilings, Roman sculptures and artifacts so do try to enjoy this along the way to the real destination. - Like you, everyone wants to get to the end so it can feel like cattle being herded through a narrow hallway. Know this up front. - The chapel is small and in a hot day, can be stifling.- Since this is a chapel, it means no photographs and silence.

We had tickets to view the museum and Sistine with a guide, but we set out on our own shortly after entering the museum as we had a schedule to keep. The museum can be pretty tiring. There are lots of steps, tons of walking, no AC, and the rooms get very hot, and in summary-- you're pretty dang tired by the time you make it to the chapel. Since the flow of visitors through the chapel is one direction, you have to get through the rest of your museum visit before entrance into the chapel. Attendants usher you into a spot packing people in like for a Disneyland ride and yelling at you to keep moving. It's pretty disorienting, considering you're trying to look at the ceiling while doing this. It's undoubtedly beautiful and impressive; however, while I disclaim that art history is not in my wheelhouse, I found many of the other frescos, ceilings, and full room murals in the museum to be far more interesting. Even the judgment mural on the wall of the chapel, I thought to be far more detailed and impactful.

To my knowledge it can only be accessed via the Musee Vaticani, unless you're a Bishop;). It has been on my bucket list in what seemed like forever. I mean Michelangelo is all I need to say to explain why...Anyone can recite Wikipedia... that's way too easy, instead I want to share my actual experience with you. Cappella Sistina is considered the highest point of the Renaissance age. It's breathtaking just to close my eyes and remember everything. You must understand it is sacrilege to take photos, video, or use any electronic  devices while in the chapel. So all the photos you see on Yelp and other social media sites are highly discouraged. In plain English... just don't do it and be respectful! After walking the long hallways I arrive to the open doors of the Capella Sistina. Before entering, a large sign clearly states no photography, no video, no electronics. The Sistine Chapel ceiling, painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512, is the essence of Renaissance art. Cappella Sistina was built within the Vatican between 1477 and 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV, for whom the chapel is named. But did you know...Michelangelo was more known as a sculptor in the Renaissance world?! Indeed. In fact, at first, he refused to paint the ceiling mainly because he considered himself a sculptor and not a painter. However, he finally gave in to Pope Sixtus and the Church knowing he would be doing this work for God. And The Creation of Adam was born...I enter to a calmness. I was on a private tour pre-opening so not many were present which definitely helped my experience. Just note that the ceiling is over 60-feet high so most of the time, like some mention, you'll be looking up! The Last Judgement is on the entrance wall. The Creation of Adam high up on the ceiling. And once again as tempting as it is... keep your smartphones in your pocket! Enjoy the beauty around you. Enjoy the moment! In the end, I highly recommend Cappella Sistina to all. Although I was on a private tour, it's really not necessary when you enter Capella Sistina. Remember you'll be looking up into the heavens! Do I regret not taking any photos in the chapel? Absolutely not! It's that moment in time when you realize you're witnessing one of the greatest works of humankind.

Again, I will repeat, buy your tickets online. it will save you time.  It was built in 1477 and various artists contributed to decorating it, but it is the ceiling and front wall that get all the attention and rightfully so. Starting in 1508 Michelangelo painted around 5000 square feet by himself in four years. It really goes to show you what one man can accomplish when he puts his mind to it. this Chapel is famous for Michelangelo's Last Judgment, however, he was not the only painter who created the masterpieces in this Chapel. Other famous artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Pietro Perugino also worked on these magnificent works of art.While most people are checking out the ceiling, don't forget the front wall where Michelangelo painted the Last Judgement. It is amazing how much of a story he was able to tell in this work of art.Imp one: Chapel has been used for the conclave, the meeting in which cardinal electors select a new pope. yes, you have seen this in Robert Langdon Movie Angel & Demons. Some beautiful facts:# there are beautiful paintings that altogether cover 1,100 square meters of the surface.# Originally the Sistine Chapel was the private chapel for the different popes. The paintings, which are based on the Bible, represent important messages for the Catholic Church.# The Sistine Chapel features the first representation of God with a muscular body and a white beard.# The Last Judgment is painted in a way intended to convey awe and respect for the power of God.When you are done with Sistine Chapel (there is a lot to take in so take your time and enjoy it) you have two choices on which exit to take. If you take the one on the left you will be taken through more of the museum and to the exit. The one on the right is the secret. This one is marked for tours only, but use it because it takes you to St Peter's Basilica and will save you from having to wait in another line. I recommend taking the one to the left and seeing the rest of the museum because it is worth it. Guys, photo ios prohibited in Chapel.

One of these, and possibly one of the most unique and interesting of the Eternal City's \"hidden museums,\" is inside the Chiesa Sacro Cuore di Ges\u00f9.  It is the century old Museo del Purgatorio (Museum of the Holy Souls in Purgatory).  Actually, I was hoping to see more; when, in fact, it is just one small room with one display case filled with weird things.  It is said to hold artifacts that have been burned by the hands of souls in purgatory.  The collection was instigated by a French missionary priest, Father Jouet.  During a fire that destroyed a portion of the church and a painting of Our Lady of the Rosary, people were said to have seen the face of a man in the flames who was believed to be a trapped soul. Father Jouet saw this as a sign that purgatory existed.  Whether you believe in purgatory or not, it's worth taking the time to visit the church and seeing this unusual exhibition.  Admission is free, but they do appreciate donations.  Do make sure that the church is open.  It took us 2 visits to see this little museum!", "rating": "3", "visited": "Jul 20, 2018"}, {"review": "This is an obscure collection of artifacts on display in a single room, located next to the church in the vestry.The admission is free of charge - you just ask for directions to the room and take a look at what's there. 4 stars for this enigmatical place!There are documents and photos, like the photo of an imprint of a deceased on the sleeve of clothing from 1789 in Wodecq, Belgium, or the imprint of Palmira Rastelli's three fingers on the prayer book from 1871.HISTORYAfterlife, when deceased are stuck in Purgatory because of their sins, they try to catch attention of those alive to ask for forgiveness and prayers, in attempting to facilitate their transition to Paradise.The chapel of the church, Chiesa del Sacro Cuore del Suffragio, had burned in a fire in 1897. Victor Jou\u00ebt, who was the priest at the church, saw the image of a human face on the wall behind the altar, imprinted by the flames.That image, naturally, looked to him as a sad face of a sufferer. According to his religious beliefs, it was the soul of a deceased man, condemned to Purgatory, trying to get in contact with the living. And that is how this museum had started.The priest decided to search for testimonials of the appearances of the souls of Purgatory, and to collect them in a museum close to the church.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Jun 30, 2016"}, {"review": "When I was in Italy I googled something like \"weird stuff to do in Rome\" or something like that at I actually went to many of the things on that list lol. The Purgatory Museum really isn't a museum. There's a church and inside you ask a priest or person working there that you want to see the museum and they will show you. When you see it you wouldn't think of it as a museum because honestly, you would walk right past it. They basically have around 20 things hung up that are really creepy. Things like burnt hand prints on bibles, hand prints on pillows, etc. The stories are actually quite interesting. People who died who maybe lost faith or whatnot reaching out for people to pray for them. I don't personally believe in any of this as I'm Jewish but it's still a bit eerie to me but then again most things related to Catholicism kind of are. I stayed near Trevi Fountain and walked (although got lost mind you). It was a bit of a long walk, but flat and scenic as you walk along the Tiber and see different monuments in Rome on the way. The people I met working there were pretty friendly and seemed happy that someone asked about the museum as I don't think they get many people coming in asking about it. One asked where I was from and when I said California, he got all happy and kept singing songs about California lol....Anyway this is a little bit out of the way via public transportation (at least I think so anyway), but it was something to see and FREE!!!. I really cannot see anyone viewing this for more than 20 minutes. They do have a laminated paper explaining what each picture/artifact is telling the story which is like less than a paragraph long.

Which means that when I'm traveling internationally, there's a good chance that I'm running on fumes on day one. Despite zombie status, we were looking for a dinner spot close to our apartment on a Friday evening. Alessio is one of the most popular restaurants in Rome on Yelp (with good reviews) and it was only a six-minute walk so we made our way over. Service (3/5): All of the tables inside were booked and it was too cold out for some patio seating but luckily, the host told us that they have another area close by the restaurant with the same menu. Basically an underground patio but one pretty well shielded from the weather. Rather than wait an hour or so for a table in the main dining area, we took the host up on his alternative offer. As Americans all know, service can be a bit frustrating in Europe. Our server was attentive by European standards and he was friendly. That's a win in my book. He even brought us some free limoncello shots which was a nice touch. On the other hand, they brought us bread and bread isn't free at this establishment. If you're going to charge for bread, you need to ask if we'd like some rather than automatically bringing it and making an extra buck. It's common courtesy. Ambiance (4/5): While the service was a hit or a miss, the ambiance was one of the nicest aspects of dining at Alessio. The underground patio was lovely. You felt a bit secluded but in a nice way. Cool spot for a meal. Food (2.5/5): We started off with the prosciutto and melon appetizer which ended up being the best part of the meal. Simple yet delicious. Fresh sliced melon wrapped in prosciutto. if only the rest of the meal had been as good. For my main course, I had the suckling pig which comes with roasted potatoes. Suckling pig (baby pig) is not something I see on menus often so I jumped at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the pig was super fatty. I've had suckling pig done well before and this cut of meat was not that. The roasted potatoes were solid but you can't really mess that one up. My dining companion had some chicken which she said was similarly underwhelming. Drinks (4/5): We went with some house wine (white), one liter to be exact. House wine is always solid in Italy so this was a win. Overall: While there are things to like at Alessio, there were so many hiccups that made it one of my least favorite dining experiences while in Italy.

Before even realizing this was a restaurant, the waiters already are asking you if you want a table for two.  Of course we were looking for this restaurant based on our research, but seeing how over eager they were to seat you led us to believe this was a tourist trap.  It's also very close to the local train station, so if you're sitting outside, be prepared to witness a bunch of people walking by with their suitcases. Staff: friendly.  The ones that dealt with us kept their distance, and respected our space.  There was one waiter serving the table next to us that was quite over friendly and obnoxious.  After taking their orders, the one waiter challenged them to get a different drink/meal he recommended which they obliged to but then once the meal came out they were confused with the dish they received.  It was awkward to witness.  Separately and not an issue, but I did notice that all but one waiter appeared to be of Italian descent, which has me wondering about the restaurant's authenticity in terms of the quality of the food.  Service was quick though and we were seated quickly with no reservation.Food:- bruschetta al pomodoro: bread was not very toasty and the there were no greens.  We've had better at other Italian restaurants outside of Italy.- prosciutto e melone: the meat was good.  The melons were slices and not balls/chunks which I found interesting since you had to cut with a fork and knife instead of doing one bite (not sure which one is the more authentic style).  The melons were strangely very orange almost to the point of being food colored.  - rigatoni alla carbonara: my BF got this and thought it was okay.  We had other carbonara during the trip and he wouldn't necessarily come back to alessio and get this.  If you want good carbonara, go somewhere else!- tonnarelli ai frutti di mare: I wasn't really impressed with the starters so was nervous about my entree.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I've never had this type/cut of pasta before, but I learned it's one of my favorites now!  It's like a udon styled pasta.  The sauce was phenomenal and light with some great seafood options mixed in.  It was the perfect portion and I would go back to this place solely for this dish!Overall, we give this place a 3.  There were some good dishes, but really inconsistent.  We've had better options at other places.  If you need to eat and don't have a reservation, come here.

Admission to the park is free, but admission to the buildings was \u20ac12, as of 2013, which I thought was good value.We were impressed by the quality of the restoration and the well-maintained and tranquil palm-shaded parkland. The main villa is surprisingly small and manages, I thought, to  fall just the right side of ostentatiousness,  and have a degree of charm. Among the other buildings are the Casino dei Principe, used as an art gallery, and the Art Nouveau 'House of Owls' - a faux Swiss cottage with lavish stained glass windows. There's also a restaurant with outdoor dining in a delightful setting - La Limonaia - though it's best to stick to the wood-fired pizza and salads, if our experience was anything to go by.If you need to get away from the bustle and pollution of Rome's centre, this is a great place to relax, even though it is a little further out than the obvious option, Villa Borghese.", "rating": "4", "visited": "Jun 7, 2013"}, {"review": "- WiFi does not reach room 203.

I loved both of them!! You are at a table with a small group of others, as you learn to make pasta dough (for two types of pasta- ravioli and spaghetti) and two types of sauces (red and white). The chefs were very hands on, involved everyone in the audience, and entertained the entire night. The only rule of the night was no empty glasses!! After you spend a couple hours talking and cooking everything, you move to a candle lit table on the rooftop and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Both pastas turned out AMAZING!!!! So so so good!!! (Not just saying that because I made it!) Actually ended up being some of the most mouth-watering pasta we had on our trip to Italy. The best part? They give you all 4 recipes to take home- we cannot wait to make them again as a family (all easy and straight-forward; definitely think we will be able to recreate them). After dinner they surprised us with a shot of limoncello and tiramisu for dessert. Not only were the chefs great, the food was exquisite, and the entire group was very sociable; it was fun to meet new people!This experience was one of the best we had in Italy, it really was a highlight for us.

This neighborhood boats so many great restaurants, literally you can't have a bad meal there.  Service was awesome and the wine my server recommended was divine!! The Bucatini all' Amatriciana with pecorino cheese and homemade bacon is a must try!!!!!!  The pasta is fresh and delicious!!!! Try to make a RSVP if possible.

I work there every 4 months for a week and Taverna Trilussa is the best restaurant in ROMA. No one makes better pasta. We know because I've been to all the good ones. Massimo and Maurizio the owners run the place with passion. The chef makes the food with love. They have the best AMATRICANA in Italy. The #1 Roman dish.

The concierge at our hotel had recommended we try it out.   We were so glad we did. We were seated inside. When you walk in you walk by a case with black truffles in them. I was drooling as we walked in walked in the door. We started with their Ravioli Mimosa (a two time award winner).  The ravioli was stuffed with cheese and served with a DELICIOUS creamy sauce. I believe it was topped with pieces of scrambled egg, the recipe is a secret though. We also had burrata and prosciutto.  It was obviously wonderful. Finally for mains, my husband had the seafood pasta and I had the carbonara topped with TRUFFLE.  What I would give to have one more taste!  The service was okay, as I found with most if not all restaurants so I let that slide.  However, these are tastes that I will never forget.

Everything about this place is beautiful - the ambiance, the staff and most especially the food. We ordered our food with perfect recommendations from our waiter- who also suggested perfect wine pairings. We started with the roasted octopus - incredibly tender and flavorful. Then we had the bucatini in tomato sauce and the carbonara with truffles - both were delicious!  Made with the freshest ingredients and cooked perfectly  really a lovely evening.

We weren't sure what to expect initially as they sat us outside and near a service station but as the meal went on we realized we had the best seat in the house as we got to see the servers finish and plate many of the dishes right by us. We went with the several course tasting menu which came with various wines too which really made it a good deal even though it was a lot of money. Every single bite of food they brought out was amazing, and the service and atmosphere were so nice, befitting a really romantic and memorable meal.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Dec 5, 2022"}], "reviews_count": "229"}
{"name": "Santa Maria in Via", "category": null, "hours": null, "address": "Via del Mortaro 24 00187 Rome Italy", "rating": 0, "number_of_reviews": 0, "reviews": [{"review": "The Santa Maria in Via church was founded in Rome during the dark ages, but it wasn't formally established as a parish church until 1205. Note that it is not the nearby church of Santa Maria in Via Lata. Santa Maria in Via is regularly translated into \"Our Lady in the Street\" in English; however, some historical documents gave the parish other names. The church gained fame on September 26, 1256 when the well in the yard of 13th-century Cardinal Pietro Capocci flooded and overflowed with a painted terracotta tablet of the \"Blessed Virgin\" miraculously floating in the water. From that event, the dedication of the church is to the Blessed Virgin Mary with a special title of Our Lady of the Well (Madonna del Pozzo). The first chapel on the right is the Cappella della Madonna del Pozzo (aka the Well Chapel) which was built in 1491-1513 on the orders of Pope Innocent VIII around the actual holy well from 1256. Upon completion in 1513, Pope Leo X granted the church to the Servite Order which still serves the church and parish.The chapel was constructed with funds from Monsignor Giovanni Battista Canobi whose memorial is on the left side of the chapel. The altarpiece in the Cappella della Madonna del Pozzo contains the original iconic 13th century tile after being framed in polychrome marble and alabaster in 1646 following a Papal decree. The building (including other chapels) we see today was completed between 1592-1609 under the supervision of Italian architects Francesco da Volterra and Carlo Lombardi.The travertine limestone fa\u00e7ade was designed by the famous Italian Renaissance architect (and Michelangelo collaborator) Giacomo della Porta who worked on many beautiful fountains and churches throughout Roma including St. Peter's Basilica. The front wasn't actually completed under the direction of Baroque Italian architect Carlo Rainaldi in 1681. The Latin inscription on the front reads \"Deo in hon Mariae virginis matris Dei, dd a MCCLVI\" meaning \"Dedicated to God in honor of the virgin mother, 1256 AD.\"The interior has single nave with four chapels on each side. Besides the chapel of the well, the right side has ornate chapels dedicated to St. Philip Benizi, the Annunciation, and the Holy Trinity. On the left are chapels to St. Andrew, the Sacred Heart or Jesus, the Seven Holy Founders of the Servite Order, and St. Pellegrino Laziosi (patron of cancer sufferers).Obviously, the Santa Maria in Via church is more impressive than most churches in your hometown even though it is just one of 900 Catholic churches in Rome. The history and inspiration it offers shouldn't be discounted just because isn't ranked among the most influential in the city. In addition, it now serves as a national church in Rome for the devout Ecuadorian community.Except during mass, the church is open to visitors on weekdays from 7:15 a.m. - 8:00 p.m. and on Sundays from 8:00 a.m. - 10:00 p.m. September is a busy time in the church including the feast of the Madonna of the Holy Well on September 8 and a night vigil on September 26, the anniversary of the miracle of the well.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Jan 27, 2020"}], "reviews_count": "3"}

They reopened the tour in 2015, and as soon as I saw that, I've been dying to get back to Rome.  You get your tickets online (I bought mine two months in advance), and then head out early, because it is a little hard to see exactly where to go.The tour is mind boggling for an archaeology nut like me.  My son, who was almost six during the tour, loved seeing everything, though was less appreciative of the information given by the guide.  I, on the other hand, thought the guide was fantastic.  We both had our minds blown by the virtual reality presentation that happens in the middle of the tour.

For posterity's sake I have left my review as it was:Eat your heart out I Claudius fans. This is where much of the debauchery happened. Come and see the famous house that takes its name from the oppulent coating of gold it got from the deranged Emperor Nero who had it built after fiddling while Rome burned (probably not really twiddling his thumbs, but playing the lute, which is supposed to demonstrate how inept he was at managing disasters  instead of calling together advisors he sang lamenting songs and wrote some poems about it). Here is the room where Nero infamously drowned his enemies in rose petals by allowing them to fall through the oculus in the huge dining chamber.Brush up on your knowledge of everyone's favourite nutty emperor (except perhaps Caligulaits a close run thing) and you won't be sorry you did. It will really enhance the experience.", "rating": "5", "visited": "May 14, 2011"}], "reviews_count": "7"}
