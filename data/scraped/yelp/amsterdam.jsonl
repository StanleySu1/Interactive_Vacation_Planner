Don't hesitate. Book your tour now! This was such a magical experience and such a memorable part of our trip to Amsterdam. This is also easily the best canal boat company for so many reasons.First, they only seat 8 people per tour, so you can expect an intimate trip. You'll see those big tours sailing down the canals and the people just look miserable on them. They're listening to those little audio guides and it just looks so boring. The intimate setting allows for a really personalized tour. We were able to chat with the others on our boat and it was so great to meet people from around the world. Our tour guide was so knowledgeable. He actually works as a historian and is recording a podcast for the Netherlands about their history. He was able to provide us with such rich information about the city, but did so in a way that was so fun and entertaining! The tiny boat also allows you to get into parts of the canals that aren't as accessible with the big boats. You can bring whatever drinks, snacks and smoke you want to enjoy! Even during the winter, we were able to take a ride without the windows up and they provided blankets and heat pads.

One is a ticket to just get you up to the top of the observation deck and then there is a separate ticket in order to do the swing. The swing lasted about a minute and that included being raised up and lowered down. So for the amount of money that you pay, I don't think it's worth it because you don't really get to experience being up and out swinging for very long. It's almost like you blink and I and it's over. so my suggestion would be to pay for the ticket option to get you to the top of the observation deck.

There are so many of his beautiful works of art, it's  like walking through history. The entire museum is like the movie \"A night at the museum\". Everything feels so alive. One exhibit is better than the next. If you want to do justice to the experience, you'll easily spend an entire day, and possibly a day and a half.

I reserved museum tickets a couple of months in advance.

My unit did not work (it had lost its Wi-Fi connection) but the staff was helpful and replaced it promptly. My wife and I then used it to take the highlights tour.  I generally enjoyed this. I paused at several places to look at other works beyond just the highlights, but it generally led us on an accelerated path through the museum. Towards the end, the map leading to the next stop failed to work, so we had to ask directions to some of the stops. Overall, I liked the collection of works, especially the works by Vermeer. It was hard to see The Night Watch due to the conservation work being done, but I appreciate that such work is sometimes required. All in all, I enjoyed this visit.

It is on a par with any of the world's famous art museums.  The Rijks is huge inside, floor after floor.  You could easily spend several days here and still not see everything.  Along with the nearby Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum is a testimony to Vincent Van Gogh's family, particularly that of his brother Theo's, who worked hard to keep his memory alive after his death.  After his suicide, he worked tirelessly to organize and catalog all his brother's paintings.  The last two years of Vincent's life were a world wide of productivity but bitter sweet.   Most remember his argument with Paul Gauguin, on which was the most serious artist ... it sadly ended with Van Gogh's disfigurement.  But in those remaining two years, Van Gogh produced some his best, awe inspiring work.  This Museum, along with the nearby Van Gogh and Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, house some his best works.  From his Yellow Room and Almond Tree, to the portraits of the local town folk in sleepy French city of Arles, or his self portraits, to Starry Night.  It can take your breath away seeing them in person.We came here for the Van Goghs, but it was the Rembrandts from the Dutch golden age including Jacob van Ruisdael, Frans Hals, Jan Steen, and of course Johannes Vermeer that wowed us.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Aug 28, 2024"}, {"review": "I really rate museums based on their pamphlets and the pamphlet at Rijksmuseum is a massive slay.

Two hours later, thanks to A VERY WELL ORGANIZED QUAD FOLD PAMPHLET WITH HIGHLIGHTS AND A STRUCTURED PEOPLE MOVEMENT SYSTEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH, I had done just that.The gift shop didn't have the magnet I wanted of the Renaissance woman with her dog but that didn't feel like enough to dock a star, what with the point of the museum being the ART and not the MAGNETS. I do love me a museum gift shop, though. I loved the Rembrandt section and spent most of my time there, and also really appreciated the lack of crowding and photo taking around important works. More bonus points for Rijks? They have these great construction paper-sized guides to specific works in English - highlighting key elements of the work and opening up more room for thought. I don't like doing major art museums with a guide (first of all hurry up and second of all shut up and let me think), so these opportunities for further discovery on my own terms were welcome. Look at the guide for the angry goose!

You order through your phone but the waiters can help if needed. They do have kids options. You can take pictures of the art, though be sure to follow all posted signs. The Night Watch was under restoration when I went so I was unable to view it fully, but many other works including the dollhouses, the Swan, and the Milkmaid were all there.

Another hot tip I try to stick to with all massive museums, do a little research into what pieces or artists you are most excited to see and then try to seek those out, otherwise you'll be wandering for longer than you like and can wind up a bit exhausted. I planned to only stay an hour or so because it was such a beautiful day outside, but about 2 hours later I still wasn't ready to leave.

She said what I saw there was pretty typical of their offerings, so I don't think the rain made too much of a difference except for a smaller crowd (which I appreciated). I wanted to try all the Dutch treats that are offered there and definitely wanted to start with something with some protein before embarking on the sweets, so I started with a pickled herring sandwich, went on to the stroopwafel, and ended with the poffertjes. Was hoping to try the bittenbollen, but my friend didn't like the way they looked and I was actually stuffed by then, so I skipped them! The herring sandwich was definitely my favorite of the three items. The poffertjes followed and the stroopwafel was last. The herring with the pickle and onions was delicious; very fresh and not fishy at all. The mixture of the herring, pickle, and onions just hit the right notes together. I had the sandwich and the bun provided a nice carrier for the mixture that also mellowed out the flavors. The poffertjes are mini pancakes that were very tender and light; much lighter than any pancakes I've ever had before. They came lying in melted butter with a sprinkling of powdered sugar on top. The stroopwafel was a bit of a disappointment for me. It was certainly hot off the grill, but it didn't seem to have too much flavor to it. I expected a more buttery caramel taste from the filling and it was a bit too sweet; probably not anything I would get again.The reason for 3 stars for the market is that while they had some foods that are typical Dutch treats, it was really more of a touristy market selling souvenirs and junky stuff that I really didn't need or want to peruse.

Otherwise, it is a must for someone coming to Holland during off season for tulips. I've never seen so many tulips for sale and for crazy cheap prices- I saw a bouquet of 50 tulips for 10 euros. The flowers are so fresh looking that I thought they were fake at first- Hard for tulips in general to look blemished since they have sturdier petals, but the Dutch sure know how to grow their tulips. If you can't buy the bonsai, tulip breed seeds, etc home, you can always buy the wooden tulips in the wooden shoes to hang on your wall at home- I think it brings enough character and reminiscence to any room. Cons: there is a lot of cheap touristy stuff around, but that's usually tucked in the while the flowers are the ones in full display outside. Avoid buying the souvenirs here b/c marked up prices- I recommend getting them outside of Amsterdam (Zaanse Schans or Volendam if you travel 20 mins by bus to see the windmills/fishing village). Also a little busy with tourism and crowds (what did you expect if it's advertised so heavily?) Slightly detracts from the actual flower experience, but for anyone's first day in Amsterdam, worth taking a look!I think everyone should just buy a bouquet of 50 tulips and just put them in your ice bucket in your hotel or walk around with flair. Like the French carry baguettes as an accessory, one should just parade around Amsterdam with a giant bouquet of tulips or have one in their shirt pocket. This market is located along the canal. Take the tram and get off and it's right there! Make sure to go by 5:30 p.m. or so, before it closes. You can also walk from the Amsterdam Central station 15 mins to get there if you want a stroll. Amsterdam is walkable and beautiful. there are about 10 floating stalls next to each other- certainly the ones located at the ends get the better business b/c of their location but I urge anyone to walk down the whole lane. Just to see boxes and boxes of bulbs and tulips of different varieties is just refreshingly cultural to the eyes. Some of the shops sell bouquets of other flowers and many offer bonsai growing kits!

During his lifetime Van Gogh was not highly regarded for his work, very little of it was purchased during this period, and following his passing his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo continued the work of creating public awareness for his paintings.  The Vincent Van Gogh Museum offers more than just an opportunity to appreciate his art, but also an intimate personal portrait of the artist himself. The art that you'll see is expectedly excellent, but the telling of his story is also noteworthy.Van Gogh had no interest in becoming an artist until the age of 27, but after crossing that threshold he dedicated the next year of his life to teaching himself to draw by studying the work of others.Upon entering one room that was dominated by no less than 13 self-portraits, I incorrectly surmised that they were completed simply out of vanity.  Rather, I learned that they were actually self-directed exercises to further develop his skills in the application of color, brushwork, and facial expression portrayal.In spite of suffering mental breakdowns and being hospitalized in an asylum, he envisioned painting as a form of therapy and astonishingly produced more than 70 paintings over a 70 day period as a form of self-treatment.I was fascinated by standing so close to the paintings to clearly see not only the brushstrokes, but also the amount of paint that was applied to various sections. Take a look at the closeups I've included of \"Wheatfield with a Reaper\" and \"Wheatfield under Thunderclouds.\"  The amount of paint Van Gogh applied makes these paintings feel like they're 3 dimensional.If you've ever dreamt of actually running your fingers across a masterpiece, there's a replica of \"Sunflowers\" that you are invited to touch so that you can better appreciate the unique textures.  Making reservations is highly recommended, photography is permitted, and complimentary storage lockers are available.And that's...Henry's Take.#vangoghmuseumFinger Model Credit @danavoros", "rating": "5", "visited": "Dec 7, 2024"}, {"review": "To visit here, you should plan to make your online reservation well in advance. I do not know how early this place sells out, but I think it was sold out by the time we visited on a Monday early afternoon.  I bought tickets online about 3 months in advance.  While we were in line, a couple was ahead of us and they got turned away as their tickets were for some other museum (the staff guy said it was 20 minutes away) - so, I have no idea where they were trying to go, but be sure it's the right venue.The museum is located on the edge of a large open park.  From above looking down as if on a clock face, the Van Gogh Museum is at around \"8 p.m.\" while the Rijksmuseum is on the top edge of the park at \"midnight\". They are only about a 5-minute walk apart. I think there is a parking garage under this open park space, but that is only based on seeing an entrance that sloped down. We were on foot or taking the tram.  At least 2 tram lines run along the edge of the park, so you can get from there to the Central Station on the tram in about 15 - 20 minutes. You just need a tap-to-pay credit card to access the trams (though you can buy a card pass also). You enter the museum in a mostly glass-walled building and have the tickets scanned. You then descend a level to an airy atrium where you store backpacks in a self-service locker area. It asks you to choose a 6-digit passcode (it suggests your birthdate) and an icon from a list (telephone, camera, sun, etc.).  It makes you repeat those back, then it tells you your locker #.  You store stuff there and push to lock it.  Then you have to give the code + icon later to retrieve things. I'd recommend taking a photo of your locker's # to help. This area also filled with soft benches to wait on people, the gift shop, the restroom, and the desk where you get audio guides.  I found the audio guide useful and thought it was worth having. You then ascend an escalator to an adjacent building which houses the paintings (and another couple of gift shops). The presentation is chronological, but also has other things interspersed (letters, works by another contemporary artist, some history to put a work or period in context, etc.).  You ascend through a second floor which has a large number of works, including several famous paintings (sunflowers, Van Gogh's bedroom).  The top floor focuses on some of Van Gogh's later paintings, including the wheat field with crows (which I learned was not actually his final work). We spent around 2 hours here, but you could easily stay longer.This museum was one of my favorite stops on our trip.  I thought they did an excellent job of presenting the works, lighting them well for display, and providing good context without intruding on the focus of your visit.

Any artist that can paint a self portrait without mirrors, photographs, and just his memory is wildly talented, and his work shows that. He didn't have children of his own, but fiercely loved his family.  The museum is a tribute to how much they loved him as well. You can spend hours wandering, looking, taking in each piece of his art, and you really should. These are his originals. The iris portrait is vibrant and so realistic! The almond blossoms ( one of my favorites) is stunning.

The one painting that you won't find is Starry Night (it's at MoMA). If you're looking for a specific painting, you can search the website for it's location. The museum is four stories and it takes a few hours to see everything, so if you're short on time, check out the museum map so you can see the highlights. Plan at least two hours for your visit (though two hours wasn't enough time for me).I was so excited to see Skull of a Skeleton with a Burning Cigarette because it is my absolute favorite VVG painting! I didn't realize he painted it as a joke. They do have the 1889 version of Sunflowers in the museum. There will probably be a crowd around the painting, so be patient if you want to take a photo. The wait wasn't too long and it was totally worth it! The museum also has the 1st version of The Bedroom. I knew VVG painted multiple versions of Sunflowers, but I didn't know that he painted three versions of The Bedroom. I was able to quickly walk through the temporary exhibit featuring Matthew Wong - Painting as a Last Resort. It is on display until September 2024. The parallels of VVG and Matthew are striking and haunting. I wish I would have had more time to explore this exhibit.The gift shop is huge and they do have a caf\u00e9.

They have guests form two lines for 2 successive entry times. We were the first ones in our queue.  The website warns you about tickets selling out and about limits on how large a bag you can check.  Still, we observed people show up with huge suitcases in tow. They were directed to some 3rd party shop who will check larger items.  We also saw one woman who just walked up and asked if there were tickets available. That seemed wildly optimistic to me.  They politely told her no. When your time arrives, you are ushered into the building.  You can include an introductory lecture in your ticket (I think it cost marginally more) and we opted for that. It was worth it, I think.  You sit in a wide room with about 50 people.  A docent gives an overview of events that led up to the Frank family's need to hide and the general environment of Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as WWII.

You then check any backpacks and begin the tour. Audio devices trigger when you point them at numbered locations along the way. You begin in the public space of the business / warehouse and progress eventually up to the hidden doorway. There is no audio within the 'hiding area'. I think this is partly to give the individual time to reflect on this space, as well as to keep things moving.  You snake through this area in a slow line.  This is made slightly easier as the Germans confiscated and removed almost all of the furniture when the Franks were arrested, and the space remains in this barren state now. Once you emerge back into the open spaces, the tour wraps up with things that happened post-war which led to the creation of the museum. I found this to be an impressive and thought-provoking experience. I was also quite impressed at the efficiency of their operation - they manage to get over 3000 people a day through the tour!

One bathroom shared as you go through adolescence. No light for fear of getting caught. Keeping still and quiet for fear of getting caught.  The hiding place is referred to as the Secret Annex. Until the family's arrest by the Gestapo on August 4, 1944, Anne regularly wrote in her diary.She was in the process of rewriting her diary when the family was caught. She was sent with her sister Margot on the last train from Amsterdam to the concentration camps. First to Auschwitz and then to Bergen-Belsen where they both died in February or March, 1945. She was only fifteen.  Heartbreaking. \"I want to write, but more than that, I want to bring out all kinds of things that lie buried deep in my heart.\"\u2015 Anne FrankHer father Otto was the only Holocaust survivor in the Frank family. He returned to Amsterdam after the war. His secretaries, Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, who had helped the families hide and survive in the Secret Annex had found and saved Anne's diary.

It is an extremely important part of history and we cannot forget the atrocities that were committed during WWII. Tickets: Tickets are only sold online and are released 6 weeks in advance. They go on sale every Tuesday at 10 am local time. When I purchased my ticket, I woke up at 4 am to buy it. I had to refresh the ticket page for 15 minutes before I was finally able to purchase and the first available time was 4:15 pm. I felt like I was buying concert tickets. The website actually worked better on my phone compared to desktop. The tickets go extremely fast so have a plan and be ready so you do not miss out.Ticket Options: You can purchase a ticket for just the tour or you can add the 30 minute introductory program which is what I did. It was nice to have some of the information presented beforehand. We were able to learn a little bit about the Franks, Van Pels, and Dr. Pfeffer. I didn't realize that Anne wanted to be a writer. I also didn't know she had two diaries and was in the process of transferring entries from one diary to the other when they were discovered. The program also covered the helpers who brought food and supplies to them and helped to keep them concealed. Tour: Photos are only allowed in the main lobby and in the room where the introductory program is held. The self guided tour takes about an hour. You are given an audio guide and you are able to listen to the narration as you make your way through the Annex. If you have limited mobility, I would not recommend visiting. It is not wheelchair accessible and the staircases are extremely steep. The Annex is three stories and one of the staircases was so steep, it felt like I was climbing a nearly vertical ladder. I've had multiple people ask me how this experience was and I'm finding that I can't remember much of it. I think I was overwhelmed by the experience. It was very sobering walking through the Annex. I remember small things like hearing the floor creak as we walked. It made me realize how difficult it must have been for the inhabitants to not move around during the day. I also recall the bathroom; I'm sure it was so difficult for 8 people to share one bathroom consisting of a toilet and sink for two years. It made me realize how dire the situation was and how much we take for granted. Misc: They have a cafe where you can purchase food and drinks. There's also a gift shop.

PRO TIP:  get up a few minutes earlier so you're not so groggy and order 22 tickets instead of 2. Being somewhat familiar with the history, we had an idea what to expect but emotion kicks in quickly in a very powerful way as you see what the Franks and other families experienced.

I came across her review when I was planning my Amsterdam trip and decided to add it to my itinerary. I'm glad I did, because I really enjoyed my visit!I used the I Amsterdam card to purchase a ticket. I purchased it a week in advance, but I think you could probably purchase a last minute ticket without any problems.Moco (Modern Contemporary) is a fun museum that features unique and interesting street, contemporary, and modern art. The museum also has some cool art installations. In addition to Amsterdam, they have locations in London and Barcelona. The museum isn't very large and you can easily see everything in under an hour. They offer an audio tour, but I didn't use it.The museum features some well known contemporary and street artists like Basquiat, Warhol, and Banksy; but they also showcase art from musicians like Robbie Williams and Eddie Vedder. Robbie's exhibit \"Pride and Self-Prejudice\" was my absolute favorite and it really resonated with me. I loved how he used his art to take us through his mental health journey. I found myself laughing at some of the pieces even though the pieces themselves were very dark and depressing. I can certainly relate to some of his work and I appreciate his willingness to be vulnerable through art. The rooms with infinity mirrors (Studio Irma) as well as the large sculptures on the patio were cool too. The visuals were stunning and they made for some fun photo ops. There were also some exhibits that were very thought provoking (JR's \"The Gun Chronicles\"). Moco is in Museumplein near the heavy hitters (Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum) so I imagine it gets overlooked by museum goers. Don't sleep on this place though. If you enjoy contemporary art that is edgy, provocative, and thoughtful, visit Moco.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Sep 16, 2024"}, {"review": "At the end of a long day, I visited the Modern Contemporary (Moco) Museum with a friend (while our husbands took a break.) It is a perfect place to explore for less than an hour.   The Moco Museum is an independent museum that focuses on modern, contemporary, and street art. It has locations in Amsterdam, Barcelona and London.  The permanent collection contains works by Banksy, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Damien Hirst, KAWS, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama, Andy Warhol, Studio Irma, and other emerging artists. In Amsterdam, the collection is housed in the historic Villa Alsberg on Museumplein. The townhouse was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers. His uncle, Pierre Cuypers, designed Amsterdam Central Station and the Rijksmuseum. It was one of the first privately owned residencies on Museumplein. The outside garden is filled with giant sculptures. Check out the giant red gummy bear and the oversized rocking horse. There were also two very interesting special exhibits.  Robbie Williams: Pride and Self-PrejudiceRobbie Williams' collection of artworks on mental health illustrates his personal struggles with external pressures, anxiety, rehab and other stressors. It makes you think about the challenges that we face personally and professionally in our world. Studio Irma: Reflecting ForwardStudio Irma is an immersive digital experience. Through a series of rooms, connections are created in which you are challenged to think about the future and how you fit in that world. We All Live in Bubbles. Kaleidoscope Room. Diamond Matrix. Connect The Dots. Universe. So much fun to explore.The Moco Museum is on the I Amsterdam Card. We made a reservation, but I think that we could have gone in without one as it was not too busy on a Saturday night.

This museum is (I think) 4 stories and a basement full of art from modern day titans such as Banksy, Takashi Murakami, Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and even some Keith Haring pieces.

Personally, I loved reading the quotes and also taking pictures of the Banksy street art. Outside, you can climb on the giant rocking horse (at your own risk) and take a picture.This museum has stairs and is not a good fit if you cannot climb stairs (no elevator).

We started hearing it at 4:30 pm that's the fireworks in local neighborhoods I mean. That's about when it gets dark. We Had no vantage point until we got to the sky lounge. Literally non stop fireworks across the city scape and we get there at 9:45. They started peaking about 11:30 and went strong until 1:30 am. There is no way to film this spectacle and do it justice. Just sit back wrap up in a blanket or fir thing, and take it in on two observation decks. enjoy the complimentary champagne until you feel like braving the craziness in the streets below.  Fortunately our hotel was 2 clicks away and by 2:00 it thinned out to sorta manageable. At the venue, Families, couples and a ton of wanna be Kardashian types; More interested in selfies decked out in glamorous gold, skin tight hoochie mama couture, with ample decotage bursting to escape. So cool until one Russian princess got her heal stuck between the planks of the deck. The dashing Craig G to the rescue. She whispered in Russian and broken English, something sort of like Cinderella fantasy while I pulled the heal stuck between two planks, then to help her put back on those 6 inch stelletos as she balanced on my shoulder. But me thinks she was a working gal with a day off along with her other scantily clad troupe, enjoying not being hit on constantly, (even tho they broke out into sexy dancing right in the middle of the hall) causing many dudes to get socked in the gut by dates for gawking in disbelief. # 1 and I hung with newlyweds from Ireland and a couple from Seattle who had been Married for 35 years, scoring the last two seats in the joint. So cute was that Irish couple. I loved to her her say my name... hey Kreeeeeeegh, do you want some of our wine? Then I met some happy Scottish laddie. He was solid as a  tree trunk... all 5'1 of em. How do I know? He hugged me at least 6 times. \"All da best laddlie in 2019\" he would give me a big hug. We even managed to waltz down the isle as drunk as he was, and my size 13's tripping over champagne glasses. If there was an official fireworks display by the city it got lost among the neighborhood shows that seem to pop up every other block in short bursts. This happened constantly for 10 hours!!!!

Since this is somewhat of a tourist trap, all of the seats near the windows were always taken.I did have a drink on my first visit because I just felt like it. I got a vodka with cranberry which ran me 18 Euro. They also gave me a cup of this sweet and salty popcorn which honestly was the best popcorn I ever had.Now it being 18 Euro for one drink and not being able to sit next to the views were the reason why I would come up and ultimately leave.

First of all, they have video games, but none of the super popular games like Ms. Pac-Man or Dig Dug or anything. They have all these less popular games instead. The most recognizable ones were The Simpsons, Daytona Racing and Mortal Kombat II. They also have one of those game cabinets with a simulator inside that can play like 500 different games, but they're all just a little bit off from the games you've heard of before. There are some pinball machines (including Elvira!), an air hockey table, and some homemade games - a homemade remote control race car and track you steer from a video console while looking away from the car and the track, and a conceptual art pinball machine that appears to have a ball that can draw lines on the pinball machine 'floor' as it bounces around. But it's broken. And the racing car thing doesn't work too well either, with the car losing signal and stopping completely in places until a human comes to move it a bit farther down the track.Which leads me to the next thing about this place - there is quite a bit of stuff that doesn't work. The 500 game cabinet wasn't working at the time I visited, neither was the conceptual art pinball machine, and we couldn't get the Daytona Racing game to let us play in 2-player mode. The lock on the women's bathroom door was broken, too. Overall it's pretty sad when you go to a video game place and all the games are broken. They should have a maintenance guy on staff!The good things about this place though were the food, and the fact that you could look out onto the street and watch prostitutes negotiate with johns in the red light windows across the street. Some people find it sad, but I found it to be an interesting bit of people watching, especially since you usually can never stand still around red light windows, you always have to keep moving.

I say \"hot dog\" because technically it was a sausage in a piece of bread, but the combinations of toppings were so weird I hesitate to compare them to a Chicago style hot dog, the gold standard of hot dogs.

From the moment you walk in you are thrown into a world of medieval ways to make people talk, remove their heads, or simply punish them for a crime they committed. Not only do you get to learn how such things were made, but most of them are right in front of you for you to actually see the bolts and wood used to actually....you know, do the thing. I was pretty mesmerized by all of the things I saw at the torture museum and my biggest complaint is the lack of magnets they had, TOURISTS NEED THAT MEMORY! Okay, I'm don't complaining.

The stories told had a way of coming full circle- for example one woman in the tour was deemed a witch and a few scenes later she had to go on a fire and be burned which also happened to be a sort of magic trick because she disappeared from that room and reappeared in the next. While the topic of torture is quite dark, the actors and scripts managed to keep things light and fun without being tasteless (think Mel Brooks - History of the World).

I am pretty sure this place is near the flower market, a small little diversion with some dark and painful (literally!) history.  Pay a few Euro and spend about 30m-hour in here.  The stuff I only read about in school came to life, right in front of me.  First of all, this place is dark and cool, and covered in stone- like a dungeon.  They start of with the small stuff (saws, ball picks, tongue rippers, teeth pullers, etc), and work their way up to the most gnarly stuff (spine stretchers, iron maiden, rope devices).  You can touch some of the stuff, but I suggest you don't- as a lot of souls have been tortured with this stuff!  I like how near the end, they showcase the impaler, when all I will say is that I hope your bum likes to get torn.  Mine hurts just talking about.If you want to take a break and cool off for a while, this may be a place for you- but just remember a lot of this stuff is twisted and graphic, and can be too much for some crowds, so try to come here with an open mind.

No worries, I was able to slowly make my over.  The museum is HUGE and gorgeous (like all of the other museums in Europe).  The reason why I am giving this museum a 3 stars is that as an adult, I don't think I enjoyed it as much as kid would.  First, there were kids everywhere.  I thought it would be less busy because it was a weekday afternoon, but it looks like lots of kids come here with their school. Alot of the exhibits were taken over by kids, so I did not even get to try them (they did look pretty cool).  There was also a science lab that you can participate in (I spent a few minute doing the experiment). All in all, I spent about 45 minutes here.  I am not sure as an adult I would come back here.

Supposedly Paradox is well known for the best shop with the very most sought after space cake as far as cost and taste.A slice of regular space cake here will run you about 6 Euros and according to their instructions each slice contains \"1gr\" of cannabis or whatever that means. Being from California, we're more use to higher grade quality \"space cake\" here that's lab tested and clearly states mg of active THC. So 1gram, who knows what that really means. What I can say, is in my opinion, the space cake was rather tame. While it did provide a interesting evening of wandering around the streets of Amsterdam, I ended up eating the whole slice at once to get desired effects. The cake itself tasted really good, hardly any cannabis after taste. However, if you're not use to it, follow the instructions carefully. Heard lots of stories of tourists eating this stuff and ending up on the side of the street crying their eyes out. Inside the actual shop itself you'll find more locals than tourists. Paradox isn't as close to the touristy area as a lot of the shops are in central. I don't smoke cannabis, so I can't give you any insight on anything else they sell here.

You know the saying \"When in Rome...\", well, this stop falls into the category of \"When in Amsterdam...\"I don't typically find myself at sex museums, but this time, I figured what the hell. Located in the Red Light District, this charmer of a museum aims to strike visitors from the get go with a Dutch female mannequin perched upon a bicycle with a dildo pumping in out and out as she merrily pedals along. Oh what? You don't regularly see Dutch gals on bikes getting it as they roll along? I have to say it was a sour start to the visit. I had hoped the museum would take a moderate stance that didn't objectify women throughout every inch of the four-story building. However, my friend and I entered with an open mind (he seemed to be especially excited) and curious approach.The museum is organized into four small rooms that continue to wind upward floor after floor. One would expect even an Erotic Museum to have nameplates to describe the clay sculptures of Chinese women double-teaming a man sporting a golden, leg-like rod and papyrus covered with naked fairies you find yourself gazing upon. Unfortunately, their were no such nameplates - rather, they were described with simple plates like \"China 1945\" or \"Madonna 1989\".  In addition to a lack of nameplates, there seems to be no particular organization or pattern from room to room (other than the dedicated S+M floor complete with a mannequin draped upon a chained chair perfect for perverted picture opps). I prefer my sex museums orderly and with rhythm.  Maybe I'm a snobby museum-goer, but I'm not going to deny that I like to know what the hell I'm looking at and a building full of sex-related nicknacks isn't going to cut it.One last note, be sure to peek your head in the cartoony side room complete with ceramic mushrooms to sit upon and the.weirdest.fucking.film. you've ever seen. I believe this cartoon porn was created in America based on the English dialect. Imagine (yes, I said imagine - so play along): a cartoon female with only her breasts exposed and cats and other talking animals \"putting it to her\" or battling raging boners. Weird. Really weird.

Do not come here if you are of the conservative kind, expecting to see G rated paintings and statues. It's pretty much dicks and dildos galore, and most of the depicted scenes are pretty demented. The room full of black and white antiquated porn is interesting, but not nearly as great as the room filled with mushrooms. Take a seat on one of these huge mushrooms, maybe pop a magic one you bought earlier in the day and enjoy the most fucked up movie you will ever watch.

If you are visiting Amsterdam for say, three days, this is not the place you'd want to waste your time. However, if you are done 'windowshopping' around the neighborhood, or end up needing shelter for one of the Netherlands' famous downpours - go ahead and push your boundaries for a few minutes.

Therefore, it led to these private churches within peoples' homes - this being one of them, and one of the only that has survived. It's very cool seeing this church within a home.

The northern half of the region (which constitutes present-day Netherlands) had a significant minority practicing Calvinism (a form of Protestantism) and were increasingly distressed by the many grievances against them by an increasingly fervent Catholic Spain. As a result the 80 Years War took place with the end result leading to the formation of the new Dutch Republic. The newly-formed government enacted measures that ensured that Calvinism would become the predominant religion of the country. Presumably as retribution for the anti-Protestant measures passed in Spain the government made practicing Catholicism illegal but in reality turned a blind eye as long as the religion was not practiced openly. Hence the concept of \"schuilkerk\" - the clandestine church. Jan Hartman was a wealthy merchant. He used his wealth to purchase a house on Oudezijds Voorburgwal and two adjoining properties. He immediately began extension work on the property. His magnum opus was to combine the attics of the three houses and turn it into a schuilkerk that allowed 150 Catholics to worship in secret.At some point Catholics were eventually allowed to worship freely, cumulating with the completion of the Saint Nicholas Church. This made the attic church now obsolete. A few years later the church was converted into a museum, which is now the second oldest museum in Amsterdam after the Rijksmuseum. LOGISTICS- Open almost every day with the exception of King's Day.- Hours: Mon-Sat 10am-6pm, Sun 1-6pm.- Cost: \u20ac12.50 (includes audioguide).- As is the case with many Amsterdam canal houses, while the entrance to the museum is accessible the house and church are not suited for wheelchair users or people with mobility issues.The visit can be divided up into 3 different regions of the house.1. Front house. The most prominent feature is the \"sael\" (grand parlor), where Hartman would receive guests. Taking up two floors, the most noticeable feature about the room is the emphasis on symmetry in form and decoration. This room was also decorated in such a way to emphasize his status as a successful businessman.2. The church in the attic. The entire museum is named after this particular feature. Notable features include the altarpiece painting (\"Baptism of Jesus\" by Jacob de Wit), a hidden pulpit, an altar to the Virgin Mary in the back and the views of the church as well as the outside from the two balconies. 3. Back house. This contained the living quarters of the resident priest at the time, Petrus Parmentier. While Hartman owned the building he allowed the priest to live there as long as he pleased. When Hartman died he left behind a lot of debt and the family was forced to sell the house so the priest was then left to find accommodations elsewhere.***One of my favorite parts about visiting Amsterdam was exploring the canal houses. Since canal houses are much longer than they are wide the houses have unique features that are particularly suited for clandestine functions. While the most famous example is Anne Frank's house, this is another example of such a house with a need to conduct business in secret. If you love exploring the various nooks and crannies of the Anne Frank House you'll certainly love exploring this house as well. It's also a great alternative if you want to visit a canal house with an attached back house (achterhuis) but don't want to go through the hassle of securing a ticket for the Anne Frank House. Due to its purpose as a clandestine church it's one of the more unique church/museum experiences I had in Europe. I had a lot of fun here and learned a lot more about the role of tolerance as it pertained to religion in Amsterdam.

It turned out that a working prostitute was stabbed to death by a customer while inside her window space just a matter of minutes before our group arrived.On a third try geographically farther down we successfully entered Amsterdam's main Red Light District.  Different than Hamburg, where women are not allowed inside the city's designated Red Light District, here men and women are permitted to congregate together, and bars and restaurants abound in addition to sex shops, live shows, and working girls standing in windows along narrow alleyways off main streets.  The women showing themselves to potential customers were by and large tall and quite attractive.  Except for the presence of the human window displays, a passerby might think he or she was just in any other fun area of a major metropolitan city.  Tour guide Kimberly provided interesting facts and historical commentary about the district as Diane, I, and the rest of our group walked several blocks as sightseers.  The atmosphere on the streets was convivial, as several loud bar goers could be seen and heard imbibing beer and other alcoholic beverages just inside the front of several taverns dotting a main street.  Both tourists and locals were in abundance in the early evening when our 90-minute tour unfolded.  It ended with an included drink at a local bar/restaurant just outside the Red Light District.  From what we were told, this type of tour inside the district may soon be legislated out of existence by local lawmakers, and strong political interests are seeking to push the prostitutes out of this special zone altogether.  The recent murder of a professional prostitute here in plain daylight will likely provide additional fodder for the critics who argue that prostitution is inherently dangerous, and should not be legally protected or allowed in a special authorized geographical zone.

Bicycle on the railing, flower pots, and canals. That's picture-perfect scene and that's Amsterdam identity. There are a few spots that are totally mesmerized. Near Anne frank house ( Jordaan Area) or central station. Some spots are just amazing. You just wanna sit at the edge or take some cruise tour or sip coffee in one of the 100s cafes near to canals.

I definitely got a good sense for some of the history in the working class area of Jordann where the tour took place. Many of our food samples were truly delicious and gave such a good sense of the history and some showed how the meshing of the Indonesian Dutch Colonies have added touches of Asian influence to the cuisine. We sampled Dutch pancakes, cheeses, butcher shop sausages, salted herring, incredibly tasty fried cod, Dutch apple pie, Surinam sandwiches & plantains, pastry, Dutch beer & bitterballen. All interesting and often fabulous!We've done food tours in several cities and although I love writing rave reviews, less than stellar experiences deserve honest, constructive feedback. Our guide admitted he was very new to his job and still learning. Two other more seasoned people also were in attendance. There were 12 people on the tour plus the 3 guides. Fifteen people require a lot of space and many of the little shops were far too tiny for this big group. In 4 hours we made 9 stops - 3 were seated & 6 were standing crunched into very crowded spaces. Accommodations this tight wear on the best of travelers. Also our new guide struggled sometimes during his presentation. I would have expected the 2 other people to chime in occasionally to help balance out the missing pieces. Instead they let him stumble and it was uncomfortable for all of us. For a new presenter, this group was just too large. Lastly we chose this particular tour because it was supposed to start with a canal tour & champagne, then the restaurant tour would follow. The day before our tour we received an email saying that part of our tour had been cancelled & we'd be refunded the canal portion, which they've indeed done. But it was disappointing nonetheless.

Regrettably the day before the tour I got an email cancelling the canal portion due to not meeting minimum sign ups. OK. I get it. They are refunding the difference in price but it was slightly disappointing. However, given that there were 13 of us on the walking tour I'm curious why none of those people opted for the boat adder. While I enjoyed seeing the Jordaan neighborhood and learning about the working class heritage there, the initial use of the canals as places to dump your raw sewage (kind of an odd fact when you're about to eat some food in 2 minutes), and sampling several local foods, I think there were a few missteps. But first the good. We did get to sample a wide diversity of food representing the multicultural nature of the community. Some of the traditional Dutch foods, however, were my favorite including the fried cod, fresh herring, and the \"original\" Dutch Apple pie from 400 years ago! That was awesome. Some of other stops were quite good and I enjoyed having a beer with my pancakes!The not so good? Well, 13 people is FAR TOO MANY and it was evident every time we had to squeeze into a place or around a table. Not to mention that it's harder to herd up the stragglers and you know there always are a few. That was not fun. Secondly, the tour seemed a little unorganized. I know they are scripted but it just felt like things weren't moving as smoothly as any of us expected. Could have been that our guide had only been doing this for a couple of months. In addition, although he was a really nice guy, he didn't seem to capture everyone's attention. Again, could be that he's relatively new. In the end it turned out fine.

I appreciate the church's use of technology.  It's the only church I've seen with electronic confessionals.  The church also has  a very well designed and branded website.   There are 5 churches in this conglomerate and St. Nicholas is the most ornate.  The dome of the church is visually awesome, intricately constructed.   I had to take photos. St Nicholas is a beautiful work of art and I like it more inside than outside.   I very well understand the decades sometimes centuries of toil and pain artisans went through to create Art to please the church's exacting standards.  The Sistine  Chapel is probably the epitome of that dedication.  For these historical reasons, I've come to appreciate  pre 1900 churches all over the world.

The overall experience was amazing, sadly we forgot the names of the two awesome staff members however this post applies to whomever was working on 12/30. The boat was beautiful and intimate. The two staff members were gracious and helpful. Our captain was especially friendly, and was able to provide fun facts/knowledge about the area as we sailed. We sat up front near the captain which I HIGHLY recommend because we were able to interact w/ the captain and ask questions about the city as we toured. We happened to be present for the Amsterdam light festival, and our captain took us past the light exhibitions while explaining each one. The FOOD WAS AMAZING!! We booked thinking it would be a great experience and did not expect the food to be as top notch as it was. Each course was delicious, there was vegetarian options, and the dessert platter was to die for.  Between the romantic ambiance, friendly staff, beautiful canal views, and amazing food -- it is definitely worth the price and more.

Since I knew we'd be in this area on night, it became the perfect spot for a light dinner. I made reservations 2 weeks in advance, but we didn't need them. There were people drinking at tables but it wasn't overly crowded.When we walked in around 8pm, about an hour early for our reservation, we were seated immediately and told that the kitchen actually closes at 9pm, the time of our reservation (so good thing we got there early). We each ordered a beer and chatted with our server who actually happened to be from Brooklyn, NY and recognized my accent. Small world!We ordered the bitterballen, a Dutch specialty, to split as an app since we hadn't tried this yet, and the red velvet chicken & waffles to split. We weren't starving, just looking to try a couple of things to fuel up for some more roaming around.The bitterballen came out first and they were exactly what I expected. Delicious fried balls of a Dutch cream sauce mixed with flour, and dunked in a side of mustard. I really shouldn't be having dairy so I didn't have more than 2 of these which is fine. These bad boys were filling.Up next was the red velvet waffles with fried chicken - served with banana (ooooooh) and bacon, with a caramel sauce drizzled on top. Sweet and savory, decadent, and delicious. The weird thing is that when our waffle dish came out, we were informed that TECHNICALLY people are not allowed to split dishes here (weird) but I guess they let it go because it was late and we absolutely had no idea of this restaurant policy. I'm not sure if this is because the entrees are fairly cheap (our chicken and waffles were 13\u20ac), but I've never heard of that before. Maybe a European thing? I'm not sure, but we split many dishes on our trip and never had a problem.We also each had a beer, chosen by our waiter. Both were great recommendations. The amount of food we ordered was perfect too. We left full, but not rolling out the door either.If you're coming to grab a bite here, maybe come for actual brunch if you want to see the barber shop in action.

Also located behind the garden is a canal, where we saw a few ducks hanging around. Numerous birds, such as parrots, can also be found.After walking around the garden and admiring the plants and flowers, we stopped by their on site cafe for a quick lunch.

They had a great selection of cocktails on their menu. To ease my stomach I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Sweet potato fries came with the typical condiments - ketchup and Mayo. The actual fries were long wedges and were not over fried that caused it to be too dry. It had the sweet and savory flavor from the potato and salt respectively. Main part are the cocktails. I picked a gin variety to be consist. First drink was the Cordial Beat. It's a multi color mixer that has a look of greatness and honestly a decent but forgetful drink. It was photogenic with its purple top and beige bottom - I recommend mixing before trying. Overall a decent first drink.The second but the winner for me is the Verdant- the midori stands out from the mix. Served in a coupe glass it was smooth and light. I can have seconds and more. The slight sourness from the lemon is complemented with the sweetness from the simple syrup. I recommend you try it. Customer service was great. I sat at the bar and within maybe 3-5 min I was acknowledging and I put in my order. The fries came out within a couple of minutes and got my first cocktail around the same time too. Inside- it a really nice looking place at night. The color scheme is dark but well lit for walking around. They had a DJ there - unsure if it's every day kind of thing but he was placing nice disco techno. Next time I'll try the burger and see. However if you're grabbing drinks - I recommend this place.Update: I tried their Bunless Burger. They did not ask me how I wanted the meat to be cooked so it was served well done, topped with a portobello mushroom. It wasn't the greatest but it was decent enough for me.

I was to learn that he purchased this exorbitantly lavish four-story home very early in his career. Unlike practically every other artist of his time, he didn't have to wait to hit his zenith. Happily and madly in love with his wife, he also rocketed to stardom as a painter almost instantly, receiving the most coveted commissions for portraits and group paintings for unprecedented fees. Rembrandt collected other painters' artworks and also represented them. The walls of the house are richly adorned with great art work and the furnishings are splendid. This was a life reserved for nobility and only the most successful of merchants, not a young artist! The 4th floor of the house was devoted to the \"mass production\" of his art and that of others. Three apprentices worked in the light-filled area, a printing press cranked out his engravings and also his printmaking. We are given the opportunity to see how he mixed his paints, and also to buy the powders in the gift shop below. He would lose his beloved wife 9 years later, probably from tuberculosis. 19 years after moving in, he'd lose this home and his vast collections to bankruptcy... his shop-a-holic behavior and political missteps would get him into a heap of trouble. There are so many great museums to visit in this fair city, but I'd rank Rembrandt House among the top 5, just after the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh museum, the Anne Frank house, and the Stedelijk Museum.

However it is usually crowded with tourists, there is no where to sit, no outdoor seating and most importantly no ventilation. If you don't smoke weed or drink coffee you really have no reason to go here, as they don't serve real feed only space brownies (which I would only suggest to experienced weed users). The space cakes are 7 Euro's and take a few hours to kick in. Much cheaper then paying for all the stuff and rolling one yourself, although I did see a lot of people doing this as well. Downside to this place is no real food, they do sell chips and small snacks like this but that is about it. So once you are super hungry from inhaling all the secondhand weed smoke you will have to leave to go find some real food.The decor is all wood, a bit dingy/dirty looking but overall a cool place to hangout.  It is really too bad they have no real outdoor seating since they are right on the canal, but what can you do. Overall an okay place to see mostly just for this history, it has been around forever.

( New York Times, dated July 26, 2021) QR codes -- essentially a kind of bar code that allows transactions to be touchless -- have emerged as a permanent tech fixture from the coronavirus pandemic. Restaurants have adopted them en masse, retailers including CVS and Foot Locker have added them to checkout registers, and marketers have splashed them all over retail packaging, direct mail, billboards and TV advertisements.Story continues below advertisementContinue reading the main storyBut the spread of the codes has also let businesses integrate more tools for tracking, targeting and analytics, raising red flags for privacy experts. That's because QR codes can store digital information such as when, where and how often a scan occurs. They can also open an app or a website that then tracks people's personal information or requires them to input it.As a result, QR codes have allowed some restaurants to build a database of their customers' order histories and contact information. At retail chains, people may soon be confronted by personalized offers and incentives marketed within QR code payment systems.\"People don't understand that when you use a QR code, it inserts the entire apparatus of online tracking between you and your meal,\" said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"Suddenly your offline activity of sitting down for a meal has become part of the online advertising empire.\"", "rating": "1", "visited": "Jun 8, 2023"}, {"review": "Just awful.

The grounds are something out of a dream - greenery everywhere, gorgeous architecture, and tons of quiet space. Nothing like the zoos here in NYC. The only NYC zoo that could come remotely close to Artis is the Central Park Zoo which is much smaller and much more crowded. This zoo provides a much different experience.Although beautiful, I was still a little heartbroken to see the lions in cages that were too small, and the elephant sadly swaying with a \"get me out of here\" face. I really couldn't bear it. That's when I was able to talk to a sweet woman who worked at the zoo. I asked her about the lemurs who are allowed to roam free in certain areas, and I asked her if they were recent rescues. She mentioned that they're an endangered species and the lemur we were looking at had lost his parents, so that's when the zoo stepped in to make sure he had a home AND that this  species doesn't go extinct. That made me feel better about this particular animal, but I still couldn't shake the sadness in the eyes of the lions and elephants. Do what you will with that, but those are my personal feelings. I did see that some other smaller animals were very playful and had adequate space to roam. This is why I'm so torn about the whole \"zoo\" idea.Whether you want to debate about the ethics or not, it cannot be denied that the space itself is quite  lavish and lush, and the grounds are indeed beautiful.

I find them a bit overhyped. Boer Geert, however, oohh dang! Warm, crunchy savory, gooey, spicy deliciousness in a bun, or baguette, or focaccia, or bruschetta. I love almost love all of the sandwiches at this little Italian food stand but a few steps and 2 stalls into the Ten Katemarkt from the Kinkerstraat. My personal favorites is the \"Warm Vlees\" (warm meat) sandwich which is savory and flavorful with spices but not spicy/hot, at all! Because it's quite salty, I like this sandwich with some mayo. Check out the pics! It only costs \u20ac2.5 or \u20ac3 !!! You HAVE to try it! Another amazing sandwich is the Bruschetta! It's with brie and ham and some other things... I don't know exactly why but, this sandwich is just mesmerizingly good! When you take your first bite into the freshly baked, mushy on the inside, crunchy on the outside bruschetta which is then roasted for you upon ordering it, you forget all but that moment of you and your sandwich... together... in absolute peace, and yet excitement. A moment of clarity and revelation (of nothing else but how awesome that sandwich is... I mean... it's a sandwich, not a super potion, for goodness' sake). Enough with the foodporn. Go here! Buy a sandwich or two! Do it! No, stop contemplating. I speak not from the heart, but from scientific research (that may or may not be nonexistent) when I say that this place is awesome!. Some of the sandwiches are a guilty pleasure for me since they contain pork and I strive not to eat (much) pork. But the occasional ham here and bacon there shouldn't be too big of a problem, right? The focaccia is with chicken, they have chicken (filet, not sausage) and pastrami which they grill on a hotplate right in front of you, the bruschetta is amazing as stated above, the \"warm vlees\" is awesome, too, the brattwurst is delicious (better than the Hema rookworst), the Mexican mix is a bit spicy, the meatballs I have yet to try, as do I with the teriyaki beef and probably more.They also sell fresh Italian stuff such as, different kinds of olives, variously prepared anchovies and other small fish, cheese etc. You can also Pin here i.e. you can pay by Dutch debit card! I haven't tried using a credit card.There are 3 of those wooden tables and park benches where you can enjoy your sandwiches.", "rating": "5", "visited": "Apr 12, 2014"}, {"review": "A steak sandwich with a twist!
