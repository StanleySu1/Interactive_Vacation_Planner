If you're still hesitating whether you should go, the answer is: yes, absolutely. Not only because of the beautiful architecture but also because of the immersive dive into hinduism and indian culture that the people here kindly share with you. If you're coming from central London by public transport, I suggest taking bus 206 from Wembley Park, which stops near the side of the temple, so walking to the front gates barely takes any time. If you have any bags bigger than your palm, you need to drop it across from the gates at the bag drop in the car park. (At the other end of the car park, there is an indian restaurant and a supermarket that you can visit too.) After entering through the gate, you will go through a security check, then you can head in. Coats can go inside as there are hangers in the little rooms where you store your shoes (women on the right, men on the left). Inside, you cannot take any photos, which is a shame, but it makes you take in everything so much more. There's the hindu exhibition (2 GBP, or free with London Pass) where you can scan a QR code for a guide book; and across from that a chamber where you can witness the abhishek ceremony (if you come at the right time, otherwise it's closed.) Near that, there is a staircase and a lift to go upstairs to the inner sanctum, where you can see sacred sculptures and images.

At the time of building at the end of the last century, it was the largest Hindu Mandir outside of India. Made of Indian and Italian marble, Bulgarian limestone, Burmese teak and English oak, the materials are of the finest, the carvings exquisitely carved in India, imported and assembled here. The adjoining Haveli is a cornucopia of geometric, wood patterns, a little reminiscent of Moorish art.

The Charterhouse is a contemporary almshouse and community, as well as a heritage site in the heart of London. Its origins date back to the 14th century when land which is now Charterhouse Square was bought for use as a burial site for victims of the Black Death. A Chapel to pray for their souls was built nearby, and this eventually became part of the largest Carthusian monastery in England where an order of monks lived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII\u2019s reign. The Charterhouse was then rebuilt as a grand Tudor mansion which had a succession of influential owners who hosted prestigious guests, and in 1611 a charitable trust made provision for an almshouse and a school on the site. The school eventually moved to Surrey in 1872, but the almshouse still remains and we now welcome visitors to our historic site on tours or for our public events.", "category": "Historic Sites", "breadcrumbs": ["Europe", "United Kingdom (UK)", "England", "London", "Things to Do in London", "The Charterhouse"], "hours": "10:30 AM - 4:30 PM", "duration": "Duration: 1-2 hours", "address": "Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6AN England", "neighborhood": "Neighborhood: Clerkenwell", "rating": 0, "getting_there": ["Barbican \u2022 2 min walk", "Farringdon \u2022 5 min walk"], "top_reviews": [{"title": "A gem", "review": "This is a gem in the City of London and unknown to many.

Firstly, I need to point out that you cannot just walk up and go inside (which is how I remembered it). After fighting our way through London traffic and people, we were shocked to find two lines to enter the museum; people who had \"pre-booked\" and people who hadn't. So even though you don't need to actually pay to enter, you will want to pre-book a timeslot to avoid having to queue outside, for over an hour, in the pouring rain, just to get in.... What made it worse, was that when we finally made it to the end of the queue, we were seemingly just waved through without any checks at all. To top it off, once we entered the building, we were met by a sinister looking gauntlet of card machines that we needed to run in order to actually make it into the entrance lobby. With the huge number of machines creating a bottleneck of people trying to get in, it felt like we were almost climbing over the machines just to get past. It was flanked by several members of staff who were also encouraging us to donate. I get they need income, but after queueing outside for an hour just to get in, it felt a bit dirty. This was my first time here since the removal of Dippy. I remembered it being a place packed with wonder and all manner of historical artifacts and on that score it did not disappoint. Needless to say, it was extremely busy, so expect the usual at these types of events; queues to use the toilet, people pushing and shoving, long queues to order food and then no tables to sit at. For us it was an exhausting day. We did pay for an extra set of photos with the children with the dinosaurs in the back ground (green screen type setup).

So overall, it is an excellent source of information and education about the natural history of our world, for adults and kids alike.

We've always gone to The Natural History Museum which is just across the way, and, having a background and interest in Earth Sciences and Palaeontology, made dinosaurs and ancient life a massive draw for me. However, on a recent trip to London, we planned to go to The V&A after seeing friends post photos on social media, and, well, social media is awash with people clamouring for the Chanel tote bag that is forever sold out, and my better half wanted in. We arrived bright and early to a long(ish) queue, however, we met a lovely couple from Pennsylvania whilst waiting who were making The V&A their last big venue visit before their flight that day. Anyway, once through the door we were greeted by cheery security, and, well, immediately we were struck by how grand the entrance/main hall was. Straight away my wife made a beeline to shop staff to enquire about this Chanel tote bag (Chanel merch being on offer thanks to the Chanel exhibit on show - for those who can look beyond the Nazi connection). However, it was sold out and staff had no idea when more were coming, if at all. In fact throughout the day, and dotting in and out of the gift shops, we show countless people asking staff about these bags, and one member of staff was visibly getting more and more exasperated and highly annoyed. Honestly, I think she needs a different job if this was her attitude... Anyway, the museum is nothing short of amazing, and I cannot believe this was my first time there. Is it packed with artefacts from across the world (sadly, some probably acquired through underhanded means like The British Museum...), one of the best pieces was Michelangelo's David (replica), I had no idea it was so big - settle down you lot, I meant the height of the statue. Another artefact that stuck in the mind was a giant carpet in the Islamic section encased in case, on which they turn on subdued lights every 30 minutes for 10 minutes in order to preserve it.

There was also a nice section for movies and the stage with costumes and props from The Lion King, Frozen, Edward Scissorhands, Star Wars, and Charlie Chaplin's suit.

There were military bands, mounted guards and horse-drawn carriages - quite a show! This is not a regular event but if you want to experience a little pomp and ceremony, you can watch the ceremony of Changing The King's Life Guard which takes place every weekday at 11:00am on Horse Guards Parade, just opposite the park.

A TOUR WREN DOME!!", "review": "I have always liked this Unesco World Heritage Site, The Old Navel College, for me standing proud at the bottom of the Royal Observatory and Greenwich Park ,you cannot marvel at its architecture. So I was very fortunate, to book a tour of one of the magnificent Wren Dome tours, and he is what we uncovered on this October day. We arrived at Greenwich train station and made our way through Greenwich town centre as it was Saturday the town was the usual hustle and bustle as you expected, we passed the famous tea clipper the Cutty Sark, we watched some Morris dancing see my picture below was quite a sight, before making our way to the Painted Hall visitor centre to check in, once we had we walked under the undercroft ,up the stairs to the chapel, we waited for our tour to start, we had to wait as the chapel was been used for a wedding which again was a bonus. After a few moments our tour guide Antonio and Janice arrived, this tour is very new so you can only go in groups of 6 people just to let you know. We then ascended up a flight of spiral stairs to different parts of the Dome, the climbing of the Dome was to celebrate the 300 year anniversary of Sir Christopher Wren Death in 1723, he lived until he died at the age 90, the feet was more as he was the only man to design a major cathedral and live to see it completed, other famous designs are the impressive St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and Royal Hospital in Chelsea So moving on with the tour, we climbed stairs, and took loads of pictures of the exceptional views, there are some pictures below but I did take a few. Our guides went through loads of historical information and also there were ancient Graffiti hidden inside parts of the Dome Wooden infrastructure. After 45 minutes we made our decent back to where we had started the tour, finally your ticket does include a look around the impressive Painted Hall so before you leave I suggest you give it a visit. So in summary, this Wren Masterpiece just had to be visited on your bucket list, so well Dome Sir Christopher.", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "October 2023"}, {"title": "Lots of History", "review": "Walking around the Old Royal Naval College offers a captivating blend of royal history and cinematic charm. As you explore its grounds, you're immersed in centuries of maritime heritage and architectural splendour. Built as a royal palace for King Henry VIII in the 16th century, the site later became a naval hospital for Seamen. In the 19th century, the Hospital moved to a new location, and the site was repurposed as the Royal Naval College. It served this purpose until 1998, when the college closed, and the site was redeveloped into a cultural educational centre. What made the experience even more special was discovering the college's connection to the world of cinema. As a movie buff, it was a thrill to realize that these historic surroundings had served as a backdrop for some of my favourite films, including Thor: The Dark World.

We were introduced to our Tour Guides, Will and Joey, who led us into the ground to start the tour. We were privileged to be there on October 10th as it was 127 years to the day that Fulham played their first match on this ground. (We were all given a small memento of the occasion). First we were given a demonstration of how small the turnstiles are as this part of the ground is a Grade 1 Listed Building and no alterations can be made. From there we were guided through the Johnny Haynes Stand with it's wooden seats well over 100 years old. As a lifelong Fulham supporter my dream was always one day to go inside the \"Cottage\" well today we did. We ascended the steps into the lounge and then out onto the balcony of the Cottage. To see the ground from there was breathtaking, a dream come true. Thinking about all the countless footballers and celebrities who have stood there over the past 100 or more years was just amazing. We then visited the dressing rooms where in the \"home\" dressing room the shirts of the current first team squad are hanging on hooks ready for the next game. We saw the physio room and the small gym. The \"away\" dressing room was not quite so plush, but then why would it be? We then walked through the tunnel onto the pitch area, although we obviously were not allowed to walk on the hallowed turf. Then it was over to the new stand, which is reputed to be costing Fulham Chairman, Shahid Khan, \u00a3120m and season tickets will be \u00a33,000 a time which is the highest in the Football League. However, if you want to watch the \"best\" you have to pay for it. Then it was back through the \"Hammy\" end to the Trophy Room. Not many trophies in there but who needs trophies when the enjoyment is in watching Fulham. Then it was through the club shop and the tour was over. Will gave us a wonderful guided tour telling us many bits of information about players and matches over the years and all aspects of the ground itself. The whole tour was at our pace, (I am in my 80s and I have difficulties walking) and we were encouraged to ask as many questions and take as many photos we wanted. The tour took well over an hour.

Expect rain and puddles everywhere, especially in the winter months, so you want shoes that are water resistant or waterproof. Do not feed the wildlife please, you will see signs asking you to obey this rule, but as always, humans do what they want to do and have no respect for nature or rules. Do not touch the flowers or plants in the gardens! I know you are tempted to take a flower, and yes they are beautiful, but leave the gardens as you find them. The gardens can be windy and cold, especially in the areas that are close to the river, you will need to wear something warm, and again, it might also be raining! You need a good umbrella, your hotel will probably have some, mine did and they were of excellent quality. This is not a city for low grade umbrellas guys, you gotta step up your game! Stay off that luscious green grass, I know it\u2019s tempting, but your feet will be covered in mud and dog poop. If you look around in any direction you will notice dog trainers in the grass, and with the weather you already know it\u2019s wet! Stay off the grass and let the dogs enjoy a bit of room to play! Make room for those getting a bit of exercise, there will be walkers, joggers and runners of all types, let them pass in peace please! Don\u2019t miss the artwork and its detailed explanation by the artist. This is The Arch by Henry Moore, his sculptures are loved around the world. Stop and read Discover the Birds of The Longwater! You will find some interesting tidbits about the different variations of birds and what makes them unique! This is a great place for a date, the entry is free, you can spend time walking and roaming and find a cafe for a light low cost snack and of course, a spot of tea. A picnic alone or with friends would also work, I would not advise that during the winter, but in the spring and summer, I know these grounds are packed with people of all ages enjoying the beauty in the company of others. Peter Pan~The boy who would not grow up! If you are a fan of Peter Pan, don\u2019t miss the statue, and expect people to be there getting selfies and refusing to move so you can enjoy the spot as well. Pay them no mind, especially if you aren\u2019t in a rush!

As Egypt is no longer allowing the export of antiquities, the Petrie Museum houses what is called a \"closed\" collection. So it is no longer growing and therefore they know exactly how many exhibits they have and exactly how much space they have to store and display them. Only a fraction is on show, but that is common in these places. William Matthew Flinders Petrie (1853-1942) was the first professor of Egyptian Archaeology at UCL. He wanted UCL to have the most complete teaching collection of Egyptian artefacts in the world. As it is so little known, it is ideal for small groups (children or adults) - when we visited there was one group of schoolchildren and perhaps three other couples. (Compare that to the Egyptian Rooms in the BM!) Its collections are focused on particular types of artefacts, so that you can get an idea of the variation involved. We visited just before they closed (between June and August 2024) for \"maintenance\". They are rearranging things to show more of the collection. So check the website before you visit to ensure that it has reopened. Also it is not open everyday. We hope to return to see how they have improved things.
