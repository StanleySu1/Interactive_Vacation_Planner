In the Mediterranean seafood includes a whole lot more variety like squid and octopus and so many variety of fish. The buffets options were very diverse, fresh and flavorful. The wine and sangria are all included with dinner as well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great value in my opinion. Now the show is absolutely amazing!

The dancers and musicians were so passionate and talented. My son was mesmerized even though he absolutely started the evening off with not wanting to go!

In the Middle Ages, the church of San Jaume with an indispensable cemetery was located on the square. The City Hall was built in the XIV century. However, you can't tell this from it, because in the first third of the XIX century, its facade was replaced with a neoclassical one. At the entrance in the niches there are statues of the aforementioned Jaume I and J.Fivelier, who forced the city nobility to pay taxes in the XVI century. What the French Bourbons failed to do, which is why Louis XVI, among others, ended up on the guillotine. Opposite the City Hall is the Palace of the Government of Catalonia, built a century later. Like the City Hall, it has not retained its Gothic appearance, but at the same time it looks older, because it was rebuilt earlier and shows its Renaissance facade to the public. There are no sculptures on it, but on the balcony in front of the main entrance there is an image of St. George (Jordi), the symbol of Catalonia. The only Gothic building of the XI century preserved on the square is the canon's house. Originally it was an almshouse for beggars at the aforementioned church. In 1450, the building was handed over to the canon of this church. It is impossible to enter here, because the residence of the President of Catalonia is located here.

They said we are late for tour in English and that we should e-mail the company which issued rhe tickets. That company is another story, equally unprofessional and outrageousely inconsiderate.
