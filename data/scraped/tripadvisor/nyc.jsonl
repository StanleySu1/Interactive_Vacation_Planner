Instead of the tour we were supposed to have on holiday plants during the Middle Ages, we had a talk of Three Kings Day and the how the interpretation has changed over the years. This is seen in the artwork around the galleries and how it changed over the Middle Ages. There were different versions in storytelling and how the story progressed from three wisemen to three kings. We saw different mediums in woodwork, stained glass and tapestries. After the tour, I walked around the museum and looked at what the collection had to offer on the subject again. I observed the artwork again with a little more time and realized that the storytelling must have changed over the ages.

You could do it in less time but you may as well enjoy the lovely atmosphere for as long as possible! I went on a Monday and it wasn't very busy. The website advises going to 190th St but I went to Dyckman Street station for getting back downtown afterwards and that felt a little closer once I had found my way out of the park to the main road.

{"name": "One World Observatory", "description": "There are a million things to experience in New York City, but there\u2019s only one way to see them all at once. You can start by hopping a Sky Pod to the top of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. There, 102 stories up, find yourself face-to-face with New York\u2019s iconic skyline. Maybe you\u2019ve seen views of the city before, but never quite like this. Walk the three sprawling levels of the Observatory and discover surprises along the way. Drop into the caf\u00e9 and grab a bite to eat. Step onto the Sky Portal and stroll high above the crowded streets. Take an interactive guided tour of the city with the help of our Skyline Concierges, available to answer any questions you might have about New York\u2019s long and storied history. And don\u2019t leave without stopping by the One Mix bar for a glass of celebratory prosecco and one last look toward the horizon.

The structure itself is amazing, and it sits beautifully alongside the Memorial pools for the Twin Towers. It\u2019s always incredibly sad to visit the site, because you know what occurred there but it is lovingly taken of. So as to the visit itself the elevator up is smooth and you honestly don\u2019t feel as though you are moving at all, the only proof is your ears popping! When you get to the top don\u2019t be talked into renting an iPad because they are out of date, cumbersome to hold and honestly majority of the sights you will recognise. Not needed at all. The views are of course incredible but because you\u2019re behind glass you do get a lot of reflection and plan your timing if you can.

I was pleased that there was time slots as it spaced out the crowds a bit. You had to go through security which made me feel safe and then you head on into the building. It\u2019s very futuristic! The elevator is amazing! It is surrounded by screens and as you go up it shows you how high you are, what floor you are on and how the city of New York built and changed over years! When you arrive at the top the view is revealed! It takes your breath away! What a stunning view! Probably the best view I have seen of New York! The only two downfalls for me is that I wish there was a outside viewing deck and that when we went to go down there was a massive queue for lifts which did make me question how fast we could get down in a emergency.", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "September 2023"}, {"title": "Groupon buy and enjoyed visit!", "review": "Bought tickets in Groupon for $22 each.

A 19th century house which was lived in by a merchant and his family, and occupied by his daughter until her death in the 1930s, when it became a museum. The decor and furniture is therefore completely authentic and not recreated later on. They have extensive collections of artefacts and clothing from the period (not all on display but an important historical resource). The atmosphere is wonderful. I paid $15 and was there around an hour and a half. I prefer a self-guided visit, and the museum provides a comprehensive folder of information about each room so that worked well. I was one of only a few visitors so it was great to be on my own in those rooms and imagine one of the family about to walk in! The building is an official landmark but is there are plans to build a 7 storey building next door which would damage the historic foundations, plasterwork etc. Shocking that such a development is permitted right next to a rare surviving historic house.
