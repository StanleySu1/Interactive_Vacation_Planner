Walk downhill.", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "November 2023"}, {"title": "An Elegant Stroll Through History", "review": "Avenida da Liberdade is a major north south thoroughfare in central Lisbon. As its northern end at the Marquis of Pombal Square was a short walk from our hotel it became our normal route to and from the downtown area and the various tourist attractions there. The total length of the Avenue is only 1,100 metres, although it seems longer, making it an easy stroll from one end to another. The southern terminus is Restauradores Square. Heading south towards the river it was a slight downhill slope and a slight uphill on the return journeys. On those occasions when we didn\u2019t want to walk, usually on the uphill legs the Blue Line of the Metro (Subway) system runs underneath the length of the avenue with three stops Restauradores at the southern end, Avenida at about the mid point and Marquis of Pombal at the northern, This last stop also connects with the Yellow Line. The street was built between 1879 and 1886 as part of the expansion of the city northward. Plans to extend it into the Parque Eduardo VII were abandoned in the 1960\u2019s. Avenida da Liberdade is a wide, 90 metres, tree lined boulevard that according to a couple of our tour guides was modeled after the boulevards of Paris especially the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. To us it reminded us of the Rambla in Barcelona, although a bit more elegant and less crowded. Several small caf\u00e9 kiosks are located amongst the trees and gardens that line the boulevard and usually full of locals taking a break in their day. Numerous statues of noted Portuguese and other composers and writes and monuments line the street as well as monuments including the massive Monumento aos Mortos da Grande Guerra.( Monument to the Dead of the Great War) which commemorates the 50,000 dead Portugal suffered during the First World War. Its central location and overall appearance has meant that Avenida da Liberdade has always been one of the most desirable and therefore expensive addresses in Lisbon. Various luxury hotels and stores including many high end brand names now occupy the buildings on either side. Some in carefully restored buildings, others in new constructions that somehow blend in. Several Embassies and consulates are also located here. What started as just a quick and easy way to get to several attractions, after a few trips became an enjoyable stroll in and of itself.", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "November 2023"}, {"title": "8 days in Lisbon", "review": "My view is biased because this was my Nth visit to Portugal but the first after Covid.

After the great earthquake in 1755, it was the grand boulevard of Pombal's new Lisbon - originally limited to the aristocracy. The present street, built in the 1880s is lined with banks, airline offices, high fashion and designer clothing stores such as Chanel, Sandro, Longchamp etc. The cheapest one is Mango women clothing store, but you can easily find it in different areas of Lisbon.

In its collections presented to the public, it brings together notable works of art, tapestry, furniture, painting, sculpture, porcelain, glass, engraving and photography of different origins, especially from the 18th and 19th centuries, constituting one of the most important decorative arts museums of the country. Highlights include works by authors such as El Greco, Greuze, G\u00e9ricault, among others. In the same building you can visit the Royal Treasury Museum, which houses the royal treasure with the Portuguese crown jewels and the fine jewelry used in civil and religious ceremonies, as well as the most imposing tableware from an 18th century European royal table.

For the most part it is called Praca Rossio or Rossio Square. The square is by no means the largest in the city but it is one of the oldest and most important having been a meeting place since the Middle Ages. During this time the city began to expand from the nearby hill top castle and the square came into being, Rossio being the local equivalent to \u201ccommons.\u201d Like most of Lisbon it was affected by the earthquake of 1755 and most of the buildings that surround it date form the period after this when the city was rebuilt. The official name of the square is that of the King of Portugal in the 19th Century and the first Emperor of Brazil. A massive column with a statue of him is the centre of the square. At either end are two identical fountains not surprisingly named Fonte Norte do Rossio and Fonte Sul do Rossio or the north fountain and south fountain. Because of its central location the square remains a popular meeting point for both city residents and visitors. It is an easy walk to three other nearby squares, Praca Restauradores to the north west and Pra\u00e7a da Figueira, and Pra\u00e7a Martim Moniz to the east and north east. One Metro Station Rossio on the Green Line serves the square and there are two more nearby Restauradores on the Blue Line and Martim Moniz on the Green Line. Numerous attractions are either at the square itself such as the Teatro Nacional Dona Maria II at the northern end, or within an easy walk such as the Church of Saint Dominic and Santa Justa Lift.
