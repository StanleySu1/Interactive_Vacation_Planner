We highly recommend having a guide drive your private party so you can sit back, relax and enjoy the wonders of Morocco!! We also think you should request Moustapha as your guide because he is beyond amazing!! He is an excellent driver and definitely kept us safe on the road. More importantly he kept us feeling safe and comfortable off the road by giving us the inside scoop on what we should expect and what we should do and not do in each location. He also made all sorts of stops between each major destination so we really got to see Morocco! He did all of this in the most welcoming, warmest, and fun way possible!

We were asked to get changed and provided with 'paper' men boxers and a lady thong, slippers & a robe, I opted to wear my bikini and they were very accommodating. However, once in the Haman room which was a large heated tiled corner bed, I felt comfortable enough to remove my top. The ladies were extremely professional, kind and relaxing, they leave you in between scrubs, lotion application and watering off so the various creams and lotions can be absorbed. Don't let this put you off, it's very normal. Afterwards we had a cool drink of water before starting a very soothing massage. Again, my husband and I were together on adjacent massage beds. After this, we were taken to the 'relax' zone and offered ginger biscuits and hydrating tea...both were delicious. All this for just \u00a360 each!

We visited here to get a taste of traditional Moroccan culture. I booked via email before we arrived in Marrakesh & all emails were replied to within minutes.

As other reviews have said, it doesn\u2019t look much from the outside but the moment you step inside you are transported to another world. We were shown to a changing room & given paper underwear, slippers & robe with an additional cover which velcroed around me for my chest. There was also a locker for our belongings that we entered our own code to lock. We first had a couples hammam which was nothing short of amazing, the ladies were very skilled & made us feel at ease right away. I\u2019m not comfortable with my body so opted to keep my bikini on. However, I soon relaxed and removed my bikini top. After the 30 minute hammam, our skin was so soft & we were very relaxed. We were then given a chilled bottle of water each before being taken upstairs to the couples massage room. We were given our choice of different fragrances for the massage, I chose Jasmine & my husband Lemon. I have had a lot of massages over the years but can honestly say it was the best one ever. I wish I could have one that good every week!! After the massage, we were shown to the chill out area & brought mint tea & a biscuit. We were then left to simply chill, indeed I fell asleep. The only slight negative, we weren\u2019t sure how long we should stay there - perhaps the staff could say in future to relax as long as you wish & make your way back to the changing room when you are ready. Once we went back down, we were shown back to the changing room & paid the bill, along with a generous tip. All staff were attentive, friendly & asked more than once of everything was ok\u2026.

Before i decided to choose Morocco Excursions, i had contacted another agency, however the agency owner made me feel unsafe if we would go with him. that was when i decided to do another research and found this agency. The price is very competitive for a private trip (trust me, i did tons of research) and every minute while we were in morocco made me feel it is worth paying. My recommendation is if we find a slow response via email or whatsapp, add their IG account and send IG message, you will get a reply in less than a day", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "December 2023"}, {"title": "Great 4-day Marrakesh-Atlas-Desert tour!", "review": "Great tour! We had a 4-day tour from Marrakesh to Merzouga and then back to Marrakesh and could not recommend it more! Our driver Mohammed was very professional and flexible throughout the trip. He brought to the best (hidden) spots throughout the tour (Kazbah/Co-operatives/View points/Hollywood spots and many many more). Great experience overall we felt safe and taken care of all the time. Moroccan hospitality is really a thing.", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "May 2024"}, {"title": "Great trip", "review": "I sincerely believe that the people are what makes a place amazing, and in this case I can say with confidence that one of the main reasons we loved Morocco was our experience with Morocco Excursions. We were with Mohammed for 6 days and by the end we felt like we were close friends, if not family. He was very polite, always on time, and very patient and loving towards our two kids. We enjoyed our time and felt comfortable during the long drives all across Morocco. The 9 seater van was spacious and more than enough room for our family of 4 and Mohammed. The meals at the hotels were tasty and filling, if a bit repetitive (soup and chicken tagine for dinner most nights). The local tour guides were knowledgeable. We needed to make a few changes to our bookings (upgraded to the superior tents in Merzouga, and decided to spend an extra night in Merzouga rather than Marrakech) and Hassan accommodated both of our requests. Overall, I highly recommend Morocco Excursions, especially our driver Mohammed.", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "May 2024"}, {"title": "An authentic and well organised trip with diverse experiences and friendly people", "review": "Our 12-day tour was perfectly organised. We visited many different areas by car, but it didn't feel tiring as we had regular stops, which also gave us the chance to enjoy beautiful views. Our drivers and guides were knowledgeable and friendly and made us feel comfortable. Our main driver, Omar, had great recommendations, was really friendly and discreet, and we really enjoyed spending time with him on the road. The tour had a great selection of places and things to do, from busy and colourful markets and workshops to mosques, palaces and other attractions, coastal resorts, green areas, mountainous landscapes, and of course, the desert. We always had someone to guide us around and give us tips and never felt unsafe. Also, any questions we had were responded to instantly. We loved all the places we visited but particularly enjoyed the southern part of our trip, including the desert, where we visited a berber nomad tent, rode camels, stayed at the desert overnight, played music with the berbers, and experienced the music of another local tribe. All the people we met were helpful, authentic and friendly.

The car was very comfortable and Omar driving skills were perfect. Omar was extremely nice in showing us all the best spots for taking pictures and all the local shops, restaurants and sight seeing. He provided us with all the relevant touristic information and additional local tips. He was very welcoming and kind and he really made the difference during our vacation. Thanks to him our experince in Morocco was great and I will definetely recommend it. Thanks again to Omar for taking care of us during our trip, All the best :) Cecilia", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "June 2024"}, {"title": "Great driver!", "review": "I hired a driver for 6 days tour from Marrakech to Merzouga and back with my two daughters (6 and 8). Having Omar as a driver was a very good experience, he was very helpful, attentive and discreet all the time. He provided suggestions when I needed them without being intrusive.
