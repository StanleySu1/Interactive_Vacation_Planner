The 360 views are amazing. If you have a nervous disposition to heights this probably isn't for you but try and push through it like my husband did as it will be worth it. Even I felt wobbly standing on some of the glass platforms! You can buy professional photos at the end. Staff are really friendly and our daughter enjoyed running around.

I think this is the best view of the island, which you cannot get anywhere else. We went to the queue quite early so we did not have to wait long. The Nakheel mall is also very accessible and the entrance to the top deck is very easy to navigate, as they have an in-house online map which you can get when you scan the QR code at the mall entrance. However, even though it was September at that time, and according to the locals, the temperature is a bit better, it was still boiling hot at the top deck. The official souvenir photographer took us to the rooftop and asked us to do lying and sitting poses, touching the sweltering hot surface. I liked the photos though, only because of the view (my face looked like I was burning) so I bought them. I was really surprised to find that they were really expensive! I was not going to buy them because of the price but (A) I felt obliged since the photographer took many photos (maybe almost a hundred) and (B) you cannot get the few photos you like unless you pay for the whole package! Upon checking my online banking I felt a deep regret as I spent \u00c2\u00a367 for photos!! It came in a nice frame though but I still felt cheated. I know it's not their fault because they told us the price before they showed us the photos at the shop (not before they took them) but it was not a nice experience for me paying that much for what I expected to be a reasonable price. The photos were more expensive than the entrance fee itself.

To get to the At the Top area we went to the Fashion Avenue entrance by Cartier at Dubai Mall. The security will open doors for Dubai Mall before 5:30 am and our entrance opened around 5:15 am but we saw people who had gotten up there earlier. Getting here early meant we got an elevator all to ourselves but if we had to wait there were enough things to look at and read in an exhibition hall before the elevator. The Sunrise experience only gets you access to the 124rth floor but there's a nice terrace and we got a pretty good sunrise. You can stay here as long as you want and many people were camping out in the window frames for the viewing spots. Outside of the terrace there's not much - there is a gift shop, a cafe, bathrooms and some TVs displaying facts and statistics about the Burj Khalifa. The gift shop is underwhelming and the cafe was closed while we were up there. There are other ticket packages but they can get expensive so do your research and choose what you'd like. The queue to get down wasn't managed well and people were crowding the elevators that go up and down. We felt they could have used a couple of staff to let people know where to wait to go down so that people could disembark the elevators more easily and the area didn't get too crowded. We felt people were pushy to get in the elevators so we had to wait a bit even though we were one of the first to get line up to go down. The treat at the cafe was nice and you had a choice between several hot and cold beverages including coffee, tea, hot chocolate and juice with many options for each. The treat also included a pastry and we had cheese puffs, chicken puffs and some sort of cheese/chicken pie to choose from. A big perk for us getting here so early was that we got unobstructed pictures near the Dubai Fountains of the Burj Khalifa after we came down and they were perfect. It does not matter which ticket package you buy but it is recommended to purchase in advance. At the Top is located in Dubai Mall near a food court and the signage is very helpful to lead the way.
