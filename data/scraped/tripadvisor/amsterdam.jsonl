As a point of note, we visited in October 2023 and the Night Watch is currently being studied to try and identify the best way to preserve the canvas. In brief they are monitoring vibrations and this involves a number of devices including a glass cage/box device to help. This does mean you don't have the full picture to see, but it is well managed by the museum and is perfectly understandable. Another good thing the museum does, is that it has information cards for key exhibits which you can read when standing with those items.

You can simply chose the language of your choice, pick them up and spend time reading about the subject before replacing them, great idea. The main tips we would give are: 1.

This museum is full of cat paintings, statues and many other forms of cat memorabilia. There are also a few live feline friends running around who are absolutely adorable.

If you love cats, you'll love this place. If you don't, you'll feel you have wasted your 10 euros entrance fee. If it's for you, this is a good place to spend an hour. Located in an old mansion house, on several floors and with a back garden (open in early March), Katten Kabinet is a labour of love for all things cat. Lots of pictures, many featured cat themed advertisements going back to the late nineteenth century. Cat themed furniture, cat themed antiques, cat themed ornaments, cat themed items to buy (many being posters or cards of the advertisements), you get the gist. It's also home to a couple of cats; if you're lucky you may see one (totally ignoring all things human, it's nothing personal).
