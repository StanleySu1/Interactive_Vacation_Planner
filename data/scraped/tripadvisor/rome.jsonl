At the same time, the very origin of the name of the church is unclear. It is unclear who Saint Praxeda was. Either she was one of the virgin daughters of Roman Senator Pudens, as the legend of the VI century says, or just a woman who financed the construction of the church. The very construction of the basilica in the 8th century under Pope Paschal was facilitated by the emigration of monks who fled from Byzantium as a result of the iconoclastic movement. Thanks to them, a mosaic appeared in the church. However, as a result of the loss of ancient knowledge, the basilica was poorly built. The columns and walls of the nave are not parallel to each other, and the transept is not at right angles to the nave. After the 9th century, Santa Prassede was rebuilt several times, each time in the spirit of the prevailing fashion: Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque. In the XX century, they tried to remove the alterations of the last thousand years and return to their original state.

Built by the unpopular emperor after a fire burned much of Rome in 64 AD, it was huge in a way that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine today. Covering multiple hills, the valley where the Colosseum would later be built-it was a building that covered hundreds of acres. Today less than 10% has been excavated and even less is on display. But what a sight this underground treasure is. Well preserved due to its intentional burial 40 years later to make way for public baths by Trajan. Frescoes on many walls are still vibrant with colors nearly 2,000 years later. Dazzling vaulted architecture gives a glimpse into what a huge effort went into construction. Your tour leads you underground through the rooms and halls. It is cold down there, even in summer. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and exhibit a wry sense of Italian humor. They are able to bring this place to life in detail. The pinnacle though is the VR tour in the middle of your visit. Put on the bulky goggles and the palace and surroundings of 68 AD come to life as it originally existed. Very lifelike and borderline breathtaking to experience Rome as it looked surrounding you on all four sides. Only open a few days a week and reservations are required. Inexpensive and fascinating for fans of Ancient Rome and curious tourists alike. Must visit for those who have seen Pompeii and the Colisseum.

It is located south of the old Aurelian Wall and was originally constructed in the 4th century upon what is believed to be the location of the burial of the apostle St. Paul. The basilica is around a 10 minute walk from the Basilica St. Paul Metro Station and is open from 7am to 6.30pm daily. This is a major site for Catholic pilgrimage in Rome. The basilica is colossal in size like fellow papal basilicas more centrally located within the city centre and at Vatican City. Unfortunately, St. Paul was gutted by fire in 1823 so much of what you see today is a rebuild from the early 19th-century. Quite a few points of interest worth making effort to see starting with the atrium in front of the basilica is very impressive. This is where you see the statue of St. Paul flanked by palm trees surrounded by four massive colonnades and the delightful golden mosaic facade. Within the basilica there are a massive central nave with marble floor and coffered, patterned ceiling. Make sure to see the Pope portraits the line the upper walls, the medieval ciborium and candelabrum situated in the centre nave as well as the delightful apse mosaics behind. In the end, St. Paul Outside the Walls is a very interesting church attraction even for non Catholics. It is less convenient to visit given its location south of the city centre which means you will most likely encounter smaller crowds here compared to places like St. Peter's Basilica. Best to allow yourself a few hours minimum if you want to make way to St. Paul's from hotels in the city centre. It is also potentially worth combining with other attractions not far from here such as the Pyramid of Caius Cestius which is two metro stations north and a convenient stop to make when heading back into the city centre of Rome.", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "February 2024"}], "reviews": [], "images": ["https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/6d/83/03/basilica-of-saint-paul.jpg"]}

Smaller groups, training the guides on tour techniques and visitor engagement could have made the experience so much better.

{"name": "Abbazia di San Paolo Fuori Le Mura", "description": "At the beginning of the 4th century, with the end of the persecutions and the promulgation of the Edicts of Tolerance in favour of Christianity, Emperor Constantine ordered the excavation of the cella memoriae, the place where Christians venerated the memory of Saint Paul the Apostle, beheaded under Nero around 65-67 A.D. Above his grave, located along the Ostiense Way, about two kilometers outside the Aurelian Walls surrounding Rome, Constantine built a Basilica which was consecrated by Pope Sylvester in 324. Between 384 and 395 the Basilica, under the emperors Theodosius, Valentinian II and Arcadius, was restored and enlarged according to an extensive project consisting of five naves opening out into an atrium (quadriportico), or courtyard with four rows of columns. Throughout the centuries the Basilica would not cease to be embellished and enhanced by the Popes. For example, the massive defensive wall was built to protect against invasions at the end of the ninth century, while the bell tower and the magnificent Byzantine door were constructed in the eleventh century. Other important additions include Pietro Cavallini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mosaics in the facade, the beautiful Vassalletto family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cloister, Arnolfo di Cambio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s celebrated Gothic baldachin and the Candelabrum for the Paschal candle attributed to Nicola d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Angelo and Pietro Vassalletto of the thirteenth century. This historical period represents the golden age of what had been the biggest Basilica of Rome, until the consecration of the new Basilica of St. Peter in 1626. This sacred place of Christian pilgrimage was well-known for its artistic works. On the night of July 15, 1823, a fire destroyed this unique testimony to the Paleo-Christian, Byzantine, Renaissance and Baroque periods. The Basilica was reconstructed identically to what it had been before, utilizing all the elements which had survived the fire. In 1840 Pope Gregory XVI consecrated the Altar of the Confession and the Transept. Other embellishments followed the reconstruction. In 1928 the portico with 150 columns was added. Contemporary work in the Basilica has uncovered the tomb of the Apostle, while other important and beneficial works are carried out, as in the past, thanks to the generosity of Christians from all over the world. In the fifth century under the Pontificate of Leo the Great, the Basilica became the home of a long series of medallions which would to this day depict all the popes throughout history. This testifies, in an extraordinary way, to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe very great, the very ancient and universally known Church founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Saint Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses 3, 3,2). Saint Paul Outside-the-Walls constitutes an extra-territorial complex (Motu Proprio by Pope Benedict XVI, 30 May 2005), administered by an Archpriest. In addition to the Papal Basilica, the entire complex includes a very ancient Benedictine Abbey, restored by Odon of Cluny in 936. This Abbey remains active even today under the direction of its Abbot who retains his ordinary jurisdiction intra septa monasterii. The Benedictine Monks of the ancient Abbey, founded near the tomb of the Apostle by Pope Gregory II (715-731), attend to the ministry of Reconciliation (or Penance) and the promotion of special ecumenical events. It is in this Basilica that every year on the feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul, January 25, the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity solemnly opens. The Pope has specified two privileged tasks for this Papal Basilica: the Sacrament of Reconciliation (or Penance) and the development and organization of ecumenical initiatives. On June 28, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI visited the Basilica and announced that the following year would be designated the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPauline Year\u00e2\u0080\u009d to commemorate the bimillennium of the birth of Saint Paul. Thus, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPauline Year\u00e2\u0080\u009d was run from June 28, 2008 to June 29, 2009.", "category": "Religious Sites Churches & Cathedrals", "breadcrumbs": ["Europe", "Italy", "Lazio", "Rome", "Things to Do in Rome", "Abbazia di San Paolo Fuori Le Mura"], "hours": "9:00 AM - 6:00 PM", "duration": "Duration: 1-2 hours", "address": "Via Ostiense 186, 00146 Rome Italy", "neighborhood": "Neighborhood: Ostiense", "rating": 0, "getting_there": ["Basilica S.

A bit earlier, a company rep at the Pantheon had called ahead to put us on the list for this site (it hadn't seemed like it required an advance reservation, but it might be worth checking on).

We made it to the entrance, but didn't initially see a company rep with an orange umbrella, as expected. However, we turned around and found her off to the side next to the river.

It seems like there could be a better way than this, but it worked... The main draw here turned out to be the views from the top. The architecture is interesting - this began as Hadrian's tomb and originally multiple emperors' ashes were stored here. Then it evolved into a papal fortress and treasury.

Don't expect galleries of statues, artwork, etc. There are a few exhibits here and there along your ascent. The only elevator was for staff only.

You eventually exit out onto a series of terraces and continue climbing stairs. At one point there is a small restaurant / bar with some nice views, but we were not yet hungry. You eventually come out onto a rectangular space close to the top of the castle. From here you have nice views of the city in 3 directions (the 4th is blocked by some remaining structure of the castle).

Two statues were carved by Bernini himself, the rest by his students. However, the statues seemed immediately valuable and they were not put on the bridge. In 1729, both statues of Bernini were donated by his heirs to the church of Sant'Andrea Delle Fratte, where, by the way, Bernini's rival Borromini worked.

As explained in the (free) audio guide (available at the entry to the galleries themselves on the second floor), the Pamphilj family's fortunes were assured by the ascent of Giovanni Battista Pamphilj to the papacy, becoming Pope Innocent X. The family certainly was one of the wealthier, more influential in the centuries that followed. One of the ways that they expressed their social influence was through the collection of this remarkable collection, particularly but not solely by the first generation or two behind Innocent X. The outstanding jewel in the Pamphilj crown is Velazquez's devastatingly honest portrait of Innocent X. This painting was, according to family history, greeted by the pope with alarm and dislike, which seems a bit hard to square with the fact that there is another, earlier portrait of the man in the collection which displays many of the same characteristics, although perhaps not with the same force or on the same scale. The bigger, later portrait really is a wonderful work, a supreme effort by one of the most accomplished and perceptive portrait painters of any epoch, and just simply pretty delicious (since we, the modern viewers of this painting, are safely out of reach of the power of the original sitter). There are also three Carvaggios, each quite interesting. Not to be missed. Aside from the very carefully presented Velasquez and the Carvaggios, the paintings seem to be hung in the galleries as dictated by the original collectors within the family. Some are hard to view. Glare from the lighting can drive one slightly mad as you try to see the details of a painting hung high on the wall, peering and craning and (at least in my case) occasionally grunting with frustration. But there is more than enough to keep you well absorbed for your visit, whether your preference for visits to art museums is 45 minutes or 4.5 hours. A really magnificent, wonderful, occasionally jaw-dropping collection. One of the best parts to visiting the Pamphilj collection is when you step out on to the street again, and you realize that this mad herd of tourists pushing towards the Roman Forum in one direction or the Trevi Fountain in the other, exhausted from their required stomp through the glories of the Vatican Museum, that this mad herd has no idea that the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj exists.

{"name": "Basilica di Santa Croce in Gerusalemme", "description": "The Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem (Latin: Basilica Sanctae Crucis in Hierusalem, Italian: Basilica di Santa Croce in Gerusalemme) is a Roman Catholic minor basilica and titular church in rione Esquilino, Rome, Italy. It is one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome. According to tradition, the Basilica was consecrated circa 325 to house the relics of the Passion of Jesus Christ brought to Rome from the Holy Land by St. Empress Helena, mother of Roman Emperor Constantine I. At that time, the Basilica's floor was covered with soil from Jerusalem, thus acquiring the title in Hierusalem; it is not dedicated to the Holy Cross which is in Jerusalem, but the Basilica itself is \"in Jerusalem\" in the sense that a \"piece\" of Jerusalem was moved to Rome for its foundation. *During celebrations, visits to the Chapel of Relics and to the Chapel of St. Helena are not allowed.", "category": "Religious Sites Churches & Cathedrals", "breadcrumbs": ["Europe", "Italy", "Lazio", "Rome", "Things to Do in Rome", "Basilica di Santa Croce in Gerusalemme"], "hours": "7:30 AM - 12:45 PM, 3:30 PM - 7:30 PM", "duration": "Duration: < 1 hour", "address": "Piazza di Santa Croce in Gerusalemme 10, 00185 Rome Italy", "neighborhood": "Neighborhood: Esquilino", "rating": 0, "getting_there": ["Lodi \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 6 min walk", "San Giovanni \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 8 min walk"], "top_reviews": [], "reviews": [], "images": ["https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/a6/8d/ba/gli-affreschi-della-zona.jpg"]}
