Hotels are definitely far apart and lots and lots of walking is necessary to get from point A to B. They really spared no expense when building all the hotels along the strip. Each one impressed us in many different ways. The Grand Bazaar in front of the Horseshoe Hotel is very seedy and really does not fit on the Vegas strip. We found the alley ways dirty and lots of unsavory people walking in there. This is the only place we as a couple felt uncomfortable along the strip. We noticed a fair amount of restaurant and bar construction going on along the strip as well. Shows that Vegas is thriving as a world class tourist destination. We never encountered any broken escalators inside or outside. Everything was in good working order and as I mentioned before clean. We did use taxis a few times during our stay and we found the cab drivers very unfriendly. They were very cold and sometimes even rude. All taxis were clean and air conditioned. The drivers just need a lesson in how to interact with tourists since they work in such a world class tourist spot. We always wanted to see Vegas and we can now tick it off our bucket list.

Every sign carries a piece of the city's legacy, representing former hotels, businesses, and iconic spots that once adorned the streets. I joined one of the guided tours, and I was amazed by the wealth of knowledge and passion our guide brought to the experience. The stories behind the signs came to life, making the tour all the more engaging. For photography enthusiasts, the Neon Museum is a paradise. The signs, especially when they come to life in the evening, present endless opportunities for striking photographs. Whether you're a professional or just a casual photographer, you'll find inspiration in every corner. Be mindful that the museum is an outdoor venue, so prepare accordingly for the weather. Las Vegas can get quite hot during the day, so dress comfortably and stay hydrated. To avoid disappointment, I highly recommend reserving your tickets in advance, as this attraction tends to draw a crowd. If you have the chance, visit in the evening when the signs are illuminated. The colors and ambiance during this time are truly enchanting, making it an ideal choice. Before you leave, don't forget to explore the museum's gift shop.

They do offer lockers, but don't tell you until you have stood in line and ready to go through metal detectors. Be aware. On good note, ebay did offer large clear bags to put your purse contents into. But...it is very expensive to purchase any beverage, somehwat more expense than other places on the Strip.

A gondola ride in the real Venice would be a bucket list item but not so much here. I think you can enjoy the experience of visiting the Venetian by just strolling about, grabbing a gelato, doing some window shopping and watching the gondolas and any entertainment that is offered. Beware that this area can get mobbed with people so I would suggest visiting early in the day before the crowds build. It is also extremely difficult to find your way to the square and more importantly, how to find your way out.

Michael Jackson One show at Mandalay Bay was a real top level production. Some music from MJ that I hadn't heard previously, and the talent and performance was well choreographed and sequenced. Amazing acrobatics and talented dancers. Some loud parts, family friendly though. We had seats 'upstairs' but they were essentially at the same level as the last row of the 'downstairs' seating - so the seats were quite a bit less expensive. Perfect as far as sightlines go. No real need to ante up for the most expensive seats in the house unless you really need to be close up. Because there's so much going on during the show, it was great to be able to see the entire stage - and since the cast uses the entire theater as part of their stage - the ability to see what's coming in from above and down the aisles makes a much better viewing situation. Sitting any closer and we'd have missed quite a bit of what was going on in the show. To be clear, almost the entire theater is the stage.", "rating": 5.0, "visited": "March 2024"}, {"title": "Michael Miracle on Stage", "review": "I was lucky enough to be invited by an old friend to the Michael Jackson Circus show.
